      "[[Document(text=\"Very friendly staff; Convenient Location Stayed here with friends as a hub in and out of New Delhi. The hotel arranged car service to/from the int'l airport and to/from the Taj Mahal the next morning. I definitely recommend this hotel as a stress-free way of traveling around and into/out of Delhi - they took care of everything and were happy to assist. Nov 24 2009 Wonderful service clean rooms and well connected with local drivers This place is perfect if you are interested in keeping the costs down, while also enjoying a clean and safe room. The frinedly and pleasant staff fulfilled all our requests, and they arranged drivers, and guides who took us to the Taj M. as well as to and from both the airport and the train station. The wokers at the hotel even gave us early morning warm Nescafe mocha drinks. If I ever make it back to Delhi I would for sure stay at the Hotel Pearl Plaza. Nov 24 2009 Great hotel - Clean My boyfriend, two friends, and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Prior to our trip I was emailing with a number of hotels in this neighborhood near the train station. Vishal from the Pearl Plaza was by far the most responsive. In advance he arranged for:--A car to pick us up at the airport at 2am when our flight arrived--A car, driver, and guide for a day trip to Agra--2 Clean hotel rooms with plenty of bottled water We had a great experience. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The prices for the hotel and all the additional services they arranged for us were also very reasonable. Happy travels! Nov 15 2009 Nice place reality of India will hit you in this neighbourhood We stayed at this hotel a few times. The rooms are OK. The linens are not spotless, definitely had not been changed but this is normal for Indian hotels/hostals (unless you go to upscale places), so bring your own if you wish. Also if you use the AC, there is no blanket and it gets pretty cold. I had my sleeping bad. The first time we stayed the AC worked the whole time and the room was freezing. The next time, the AC was turned off through the main switch downstairs so it got stuffy and hot. Complain and ask for a discount if this happens. Everything is negotiable in India!Rickshaws and taxis are easily accessible, the staff will even fetch you one if needed. Friendly, safe, hot water, good price.Located in Paharganj, metro station (Rama Krishna) is 2min walk, plenty of dirt and beggars, so if your first time and day in India, be prepared to be shocked. New Delhi railway station is super close and a ride with a rickshaw should be no more than 40-50 rupees. Nizamuddin is farther away. Jun 6 2009 Clean hotel reasonable prices We stayed at Pearl Plaza in Paharganj, Delhi for 2 nights in the middle of May 2009. We got lost in Paharganj (which is a big market) on our way there on the first day, but on the second day we had no problems finding it anymore, even at night.Here is a summary of our impressions from the Pearl Plaza.positive:- email communication with the hotel was very fast (we made a reservation in advance. In Delhi making a reservation in advance is strongly reccomended, as there are not so many good hotels and prices are quite high)- very good price for double AC room (no breakfast, but breakfast could be booked extra for 80 Rs. p.P.) - 1100 Rs including taxes.- reasonable price for airport pick up - 600 Rs for AC car. The Airport is quite far away from the city (ca 30min drive). Prepaid taxis from the eirport are cheaper, however.- friendly staff- nice, modern furniture- warm water- comfortable beds- clean linen- laundry and dry- cleaners' service which was quite cheap (15Rs. p. piece of clothing) and returns the laundry on the same day- free tea around the clock- TV and fridge- a lot of restaurants, internet cafes and shopping possibilities all around.negative:- no internet- many rooms have no windows- ACs temperature is being controlled centrally, by the reception staff. Thatswhy our room was quite cold when the AC was on. We even could not switch it off ourselves.- no wardrobe in the room Sep 1 2009 buona sistemazione e buon prezzo\", doc_id='f35f6336-fa7b-4fe3-aebe-592e5bbafa17', embedding=None, doc_hash='1fdc18b243afc3c39cb471a22ba7dab8cafa8355e89759dbb1ea83c8a9b500e6', extra_info=None)], [Document(text='Delhi2 Not a bad hotel in the national capital.The rooms are more or less well maintained and well furnished.Kitchen is also good.Location is probably out of the way.Food is good and enough choices.In short good value for money. Nov 24 2009 \"A Home in Karol BaghDelhi away from your Home\" Hi! I am a business person from Bangalore and i am happy to share my experience of my stay in Hotel C Pak Inn . Past 1 year i am visiting Delhi atleast 4 days in a month for my business. I had searched for a decent hotel in karol Bagh and finally I got this C Park Inn throu my friend. Almost a year now this C park Inn became a Home for me in delhi away from my Home. After each days business meets i am so relaxed and i feels that I am at home in this hotel. The Manager Mr.Udham Singh is very kind to help the guests and i was amazed to see the way he conducts him to the foreign tourists. I must tell their Staffs Ashok,Praveen and Ravi , all are pleasing guys and will assit you without any hesitation.Staying here is a peaceful and pleasant experience for me, it is simply a luxurious at a reasonably economical price.I wish all the best and keep going C Park Inn! Nov 22 2009 Good Midrange Hotel In New Delhi Despite of several inconveniences during my stay here (no toilet paper in my room, no hot water in the evening unless you ask for it beforehand, air condition in room 206 is noisy, I had no bedsheets) I still recommend other people to stay here. I stayed here for 4 days. It is located very well in Karol Bagh and the services you get from the management/staff are good. They advise you in a very firm tone with travel advices etc - you don\\'t feel that they are giving you that particular advice in order to make some rupees (which is something I have often felt when talking to the hotel staff in India). Nov 19 2009 A great hotel I stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. The rooms were really clean. The staff was real friendly and knowledgeable, and helped arrange various tours and day trips throughout my stay. I would definitely stay here again, no question. Nov 1 2009 will be back in the future A good budget hotel.Very nice manager en staff.Are very helpfull.Shops are close and also the metro station.You can book your trips in the hotel.The manager can give you good advise. Sep 21 2009 Great Hotel! There are many hotels in Karol Bagh, Delhi, India. The C Park Inn is one of the best! The rooms are clean &amp; comfortable. The staff is very frienbdly &amp; helpful. And you can\\'t beat the price. This is my SECOND stay here and I plan to stay here again when I return to India. I give the C Park Inn my very best recommendagtion! Jan 29 2009 Very comfortable and convenient stay This hotel is clean and comfortable, with good facilities and helpful staff. I have been travelling in India, visiting various cities, and my experience of staying here was far better than in some other places. There were no hassles, the staff were helpful and friendly, and there was no issue with me checking in early. They made my business trip no less than a pleasure! Nov 7 2009 Mehr kann man für das Geld in Delhi nicht erwarten Sep 27 2009 opinioni sull\\'hotel cpark inn', doc_id='debdbab1-cb86-40f7-a3c1-4be9301f2559', embedding=None, doc_hash='ec32accf4acf283b48beb9fc3a3e9a9124da23bb0298768e3c3ce990ee82a3de', extra_info=None)], [Document(text=\"Aug 31 2009 Please do not stay here Liked most: Leaving!Liked least: Hard sell of tour/travel packagesWe only stayed for two nights, but wouldn't have stayed for any had we not already paid via the internet. If you're thinking of staying at this hotel, please don't. I just don't want anyone else to have the same experience as us.We arranged for transport from the airport which proved very useful, and the car driver was on time and very friendly. The hotel itself was down an alleyway, but I guess a lot of Delhi hotels are. The room was a good size, but even if the sheets and pillowcases had been cleaned, they certainly didn't look it. We ended up putting tshirts on the pillows before we dared lay our heads on them! The area is very noisy at night. We couldn't shut out the noise from outside as there was an air con unit fitted to the window - not that it worked, as the plug had been cut off. Inside the hotel was also very noisy with staff shouting to one another and music playing. Could also hear another hotel guest being very ill in the room upstairs... Yuk! Always seemed to be about 10 staff around, and except for the very smiley doorman, no-one seemed to do much unless they thought there was a good chance of a tip! On the first day, we asked reception for directions to the train station but he insisted on calling the manager. The manager arrived. Again, we asked directions. So when he led us outside and through the streets, we naively thought he was taking us there - no, he was taking us to the Mohan's sister hotel where he proceeded to 'hard sell' his tour packages. After an hour of explaining we weren't ready to buy anything, we left and he was obviously unhappy about it - not offering any help in locating the train station or even returning to the Mohan. We were now in an area completely unknown to us, in the middle of Delhi, on our first day there. To say this was a bit scary is an understatement, and just underlines how little the Mohan International thinks of their guests - perhaps people who do buy their travel packages get treated a lot better.Please don't stay here unless you know the area, don't mind the noise, are able to say 'no' very forcefully, and are completely financially unable to stay elsewhere. I honestly think the good reviews on tripadvisor must have been put up by the manager, employees or friends of the hotel because I can't imagine any other reason why people would recommend this hotel to others.Please don't stay here. Mar 31 2008 Clean but Basic Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Mohan International this month for one night and although the room was very basic it was clean. As other people mentioned in their reviews there were stains on the sheets and the fact that my friends had a man sleeping on the floor outside of their room was very weird. I would recommend this hotel for travellers on a budget as it was cheap and it was a good location. I wouldn't recommend the hotel to women travellers (as we were), as there were times when we felt quite uncomfortable. Jan 27 2008 Not worth it Bottom line - don't stay here. It's totally over-priced, and there must be better hotels nearby. The guy who worked the front desk was horrendous - when I asked him for directions to a specific restaurant, he asked me why I didn't just order room service, and refused to help me. When I tried to book a taxi to the airport, he tried to charge me double what we paid on our way in. The hotel is very noisy, and the free &quot;breakfast&quot; was pretty disgusting. Nov 21 2007 Not a very good hotel at all! Stayed here for 3 days having booked on Expedia. It must have been decades since this hotel was last refurbished. The underside of the basin was covered in rust. Though the bedsheet you sleep on had been washed it still had old marks and stains on it. There are no bedsheetsto sleep under, just these rugs - not sure if they're washed regularlytoo.If you get a ground floor room don't expect to sleep until late! Noiseof buzzers (for people calling from their room) and voices through thelate evening and early the next morning make it very difficult.Oh, and they give the hard sell on getting you to visit their travel agent. We did and ended up getting a package but only after refusing some of the hotels he offered as Tripadvisor had some shocking reviewsfor one or two. The other hotels were good and having a driver for a week (which they offered) as well as having everything organised for you was actually really convenient so glad we did it. If your driver is a man called Mahender, you're lucky - he's really really lovely man- always cheery and got great advice! Jul 26 2007 Avoid this dump !!!!! Avoid this place - you may have seen in advertised on the STA website but I would guess that STA have not stayed here. It is a very basic hotel and the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. We paid 15 UK pounds per night as we wanted our first few nights accomodation sorted out before we arrived but with hindsight there are a lot of similar hotels in the area which are much cheaper if you just walk in off the street.The management also hassled us to try and get us to book tours through them and were very reluctant to accept NO for an answer.The only advantage to this place is its proximity to New Delhi Railway station but as I say there are many other hotels in the immediate area which offer better value for money.Get a Lonely Planet and make some phone calls. Oct 5 2006 Worst hotel were we stayed! First of all the airport pickup didn't show up. After calling several times he eventually did, but 2 hours late. Rooms in the hotel are reasonable, but the staff is horrible. The &quot;manager&quot; kept stalking me on the hotelroom phone about tours he wanted to sell, they staff didn't let me out of the hotel alone but were almost agressively pushy about arranging a city-tour. Even at 4 o'clock in the morning they were banging on the door and calling on the phone about tours. Very much noise at night. Left one night early because i couldn't stand it anymore. I'm used to budget travel, the rooms were OK but the rest made me want to run away! There are much better hotels in this area, sometimes even cheaper... May 20 2006 Total Scam Stay Away What a scam. There are atleast 50 other similar hotels around this one and you don't need to book this online. If you are looking for this price range, simply get off the train at the main station, walk around, ask to look at the room and the bed sheets before you select one, BUT DON&quot;T GO WITH HOTEL MOHAN. Its dirty, noisy, expensive, and not worth the hassle. Front desk is not helpful. I got this hotel from another site and based on the listing, I figured it would be a reasonable place. But what a mistake. Like I said, if you are looking for that price range, simply walk around the area and check out the room before you buy.I asked for a driver and they gave me one that got us into an accident the same day. I asked for internet, and they had me driven to their sister location 10 minutes away when infact there were several places right down the road. Feb 8 2006 Shame on Hotel Club!! I spent five weeks in India from Mid December till the end of January. Unfortunately, my first two nights were spent at this ridiculous excuse for a hotel. First of all, Hotel Club is absolutely LYING about their location indicating that they are located at Connaught Place where several five star hotels are located including the famous Imperial Hotel. In fact, this place is located at the MAIN TRAIN STATION area which is a full 8 minutes by TAXI and quite a dangerous area even in the daytime. I am a solo woman traveler in her 30's and did not appreciate this deception. Secondly, the price charged by Hotel Club (20 euros night) is OUTRAGEOUS for Delhi for a hotel of this type and shameful considering the condition. I checked other accomodation around this place and their prices for a single room with hot water, private toilette etc was in the $8-$12 range. Thirdly, the cleanliness factor was overlooked as the sheets were SMEARED with some dark substance I chose not to closely investigate and requested new sheets. The floor attendant graciously brought some but after I opened them I discovered that they too were dirty and never cleaned prior to being pressed. Thank goodness I had a sleep sheet packed and used that! Fourthly, the man who collects the dirty sheets in the morning would smoke marajuana every day and the elevator was full of the smoke. I am asthmatic so this was not amusing. Lastly, there was not even any heating (in December) and it was freezing and no hot water in the shower (in December). I stay in simple accomodation sometimes, but they are usually clean and pleasant. I sent Hotel Club a prompt review of this hotel and am shocked to see this HORRIFIC Place is still on offer to unsuspecting guests. Dec 9 2005 basic but clean and central We ebooked in advance and arranged a car to meet us at the airport, a very good tip as you WILL be ripped off by taxi drivers, they can sense newcomers. the hotel was clean, the loos flushed and the shower/fan and a/c worked. On arrival we felt we were stuck down an alleyway in a seemingly grotty part of town. It turns out most of Delhi looks like this, it takes a bit of getting used to. Mohan is easy to find as it is directly behind the sheila cinema. we had no problem with the management, however, do not use the inhouse travel agent for taxi tours or car booking, we chose to use the ajanta hotels (200m away), even then we were advised to book from the company directly, as commission is charged by all operators involved. Also bring your own loo roll, although it can be bought from the shop/ std phone stall at the end of the street. I am sure we paid over the odds, but as i say it was worth it to avoid the hassle that you will get from touts, taxi drivers and 'helpful' strangers who want tipped for their advice.

Although it was 3.00a.m when we arrived, everybody was extremely helpful. I cannot imagine a better place.A simple but tasty breakfast. Nothing more to be desired[as far as hotels go]. I shall be back soon. Nov 23 2009 Top notch service... We arrived at Aster Inn after staying in the Marriott in Mumbai, and were expecting a massive difference, as the prices were of different leagues for starters, but we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were very clean, the furnishing new and the toiletries provided of a 5* standard. The service was definitely the best amongst all the hotel we have stayed at during our India tour. The staff went out of their way to help us, be it to exchance currency, to give us information about shopping areas and even negotiate Rickshaw prices before we jumped in. There is a kind of homely atmosphere at this hotel, everybody is very accessible and always ready to help. I felt the bigger hotel chains lacked this personal approach and Aster Inn wins outright.The breakfast was always hot, timely and very tasty. The Massala Chai was to die for; we ordered it everyday without fail.I read a previous review about the AC being turned off and I have to say as soon as we stepped back into the hotel, the staff would endeavour to turn the AC back on in our room, without us having to ask. As an customer who is very passionate about eco friendliness, I felt this was a very commendable simple act that could yet help the planet loads in time. I am shocked to think some customers would want the AC to remain on whilst they would be out the whole day..Top hotel, top service. will definitely stay there again when I next visit Delhi. Nov 15 2009 Amazing Aster Inn! I would like to highly recommend The Hotel Aster Inn to anybody considering staying in New Delhi, for any type of trip. As a newly established hotel, we found this to be great value for money. The rooms were nice and clean, true to the advertising on their website. It is well located, within reasonable reach of New Delhi centre (2 stops on the developing Delhi Metro). The service was great. The hotel staff were attentive, and the manager was accommodating and helpful with all of our enquiries. Some minor criticisms though: Hot water – needs notice i.e. run it for about 10 mins! Not so quick on breakfast – can take up to an hour!No internet facilities installed yet, although the Manager allowed us use of his own office facility. All in all, we had a great experience staying at this hotel. I definitely would stay here again if I were visiting New Delhi again! Nov 13 2009 Gateway to delhi.... thiz was the statrting point in india...as my flight got delayed...the driver was still there a fresh waiting for me with a smile...i waz imprezzed...while smoothly chekin in 4 in the morning i was happy that theze people have real pictures on there website of the room they were havin,i got one of them...yeppei...room service was quick in the morning ,nice room, well decorated &amp; good staff with a smile. Nov 2 2009 Worst Hotel I stayed at in India! DO NOT BOOK HERE! This place was awful! The location is terrible, possibly one of the worst areas of Delhi. The Hotel itself looks okay until you get to your room... the bed had a bottom sheet, and that's it! No top sheet! I asked for one and got a Single size sheet for a double bed! ?? I asked for a double sheet and got another Single Sheet!! Then I noticed that the bottom sheet had some questionable stains on it, but was told it was clean... I pulled it off the bed and told them to replace it! Finally I get a bottom and a top sheet but had to make the bed myself! And that was the last time I saw a clean sheet for my entire 3 night stay! They don't make up your room during your stay... no clean sheets or clean towels!The Hotel's web site states &quot;Direct Dial Local &amp; STD/ISD/Internet Surfing on request&quot;, let me explain that a bit... Internet surfing is about 3 blocks away at a disgustingly dirty place that provides computers to use for internet activities. Long Distance Calls can be made at the Reception desk... while standing... right beside the front desk in the way of, and within ear shot of, everyone coming and going!Their web site also states &quot;Running Hot &amp; Cold Water&quot;, which is true, but if you want a Hot Shower you have to ask for the Hot water... every morning, even if you asked the night before, you still have to ask again in the morning!Rooms are Air Conditioned, but it is turned off every time you leave your room and you have to ask for it to be turned back on when you get back!!The Hotel does not have a kitchen that I could see, and the food is awful! It arrives on yellow plastic plates, toast wrapped in tin foil, a dead giveaway that this is take out from somewhere else! I had an omelette one morning that was too big for the little plastic plate! I even had to argue with the guy in the dining room abut getting an egg for breakfast, I was told it wasn't breakfast! On asking for advice in regards to storing my luggage at the Railway Station over night so I could take the train to Agra, I was told without a doubt that they no longer store luggage at the railway station but the Hotel could store it for me, and I could even stay at the Hotel for another half day, at half the day rate, when I return to rest up before my flight. Well, that was a lie... the train station does store luggage! The staff are not &quot;Qualified &amp; Trained Staff&quot; as their web site states! I had nothing but problems with everyone, from getting bed sheets to food and at one point someone came to my room, knocked once and tried to come right in... good thing I bolted the door as I was just getting out of the shower (a cold shower!).My room rate was inclusive of breakfast, but when it came time to check out I was billed for two cups of Tea. I was told breakfast does not include Tea! Whatever!Feel free to contact me of you would like more info about the Hotel or visiting Delhi!I was asked to come here and write a good review... there is no way I could say anything good about this Hotel! And just to qualify this review, I stayed in 4 different Hotels during my travels in India and this was not only the worst... but the worst Hotel I have EVER stayed in! Nov 2 2009 Friendly modern and clean Although situated in what was not a great area, the hotel was an oasis - friendly, attentive staff and clean rooms. It was also close to the metro, making it easy to get about without having to shout for a taxi. Nov 2 2009 Cheap but good value for money The location is a bit of a culture shock - but the hotel is a comparative oasis to the bustling and grubby streets that surround it. However, it's only a five-minute walk to the excellent, if limited, metro system. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with adequate showers, and the staff are generally attentive (even calling to ask if we wanted beer...) Breakfast was painfully slow in arriving - half an hour for toast stretches credulity. However, they ironed our shirts in a flash and were generally pretty good. It's not the Ritz, but you it's excellent value for money. Oct 24 2009 5* Service On our arrival at the hotel, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They all went out of their way to help us whether it was directing us to a local hot spot / arranging a day tour to Agra or providing general tourist information. The breakfasts were delicious and the traditional masala tea addictive (room service was efficient!). The location is in the heart of Karol Bagh - great for shopping. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone spending some time in Delhi whether it be for business or leisure purposes. Sep 18 2009 good location excellent room condition great service What I liked - only a few minutes walk from the metro station - the room looked new and well decorated - enjoying air-con and hot shower was no problem, and there was even a fridge! - hotel staff was very courteous, helpful, efficient and speaking perfect EnglishI suggested the hotel to offer internet access. Maybe it will be offered when you stay there =) Aug 28 2009 CONVENIENT MODERN AND GOOD PRICED HOTEL It's very difficutl to find a modern hotel well located in new Delhi. Aster hotel first of all is very modern, the staff is extremely efficient and the location is very convenient ...just 1 km walking from Jandewalan metro station and just one station from famous market (Ramakrishna Ashram Marg metro stop) and 5-6 from Chandi Chowk (historical centre).We paid for a double room 1500 rupie per night. it's not so cheap if you compare to the rest of India but it's among the best you can find in New Delhi! In new Delhi hotel are crazy expensive in Connaught place and not worthed . if you choose other convenient area (the famous Pargaji where everybody goes) the hotels are old and the area is dusty, noisy and old! Do you want to sleep and be conventiently located in a clean environement?! Choose Karol Bagh/Jandewalan area... Aster was our choice! Aug 4 2009 Overall nice and pleasent service Room condition average, above average service and nice location for a budget stay in Delhi Sep 29 2009 un hotel neuf dans un quartier pauvre mais typique\", doc_id='9b0ca1d0-2cd7-4b2a-a913-4c5a53e84590', embedding=None, doc_hash='de0e9b69339fcb13cdf291b4ed3c640c8ffdb6b860722cc29072bcc29949d768', extra_info=None)], [Document(text=\"Oct 11 2009 excellent stay in good price I have stayed in many hotels in India, Metro Heights was the best of the hotel especially in karol bagh area.The staff is friendly ,the rooms were clean and well decoated with a big L.C.D. Bathrooms were neat and hot water in the showers is available.I have no hasseles in the hotel every time i have stayed here.The price they take is also not exorbitant. Aug 27 2009 unreliable the hotel provided a very uneven experience al round. Certainly there were some nice touches in the room, such as the beautifully carved bed, but it looked out on the interior service stairwell. The staff who actually did the work were lovely - but the management were dreadful and couldn't have cared less when we arrived back after travelling for 23 hours to find that, even though we were pre-paid, they'd put someone else in our room and we had nowjere to stay! After a huge row they transferred us to a scruffier sister property, closer to the market and with much more pleasant management. The Indian breakfast is great - don't even bother with the European one. I guess it all depends on what you want in a hotel - we're not after 5-star treatment, but some consistency would be a good start. May 31 2009 clean and convenient We were particularly happy with the convenient and central location Metro Heights had to offer us in delhi near the metro sation connecting to all parts of delhi .We reached Metro Heights at middle of the night and had our confirmed bookin so were checked in and found a decent accommodation in what we had paid ($70 usd).The next morning the buffett breakfast was well laid and was hot and were served eggs to order as well .We decided to continue our stay in the hotel instead of looking for another hotel in the area.The staff was proffessional and friendly.dont expect out of the way service..BUT WE DIDNT REGRET THE DECISION TO STAY AT METRO HEIGHTS. Jan 13 2009 metro height was good value for money and safe We booked the hotel through the website which looked quite attractive and were promised a pickup from airport.The pickup as promised was there and were taken to the hotel which took about 30 minutes. we were greeted at the reception nicely and were checked in . staright went to the bath room and had nice hot water shower( i was not sure i would get hot water )we were hungry so asked for food and was told that it is available 24 hours.The food took some time to come as we were ttold that it is cooked fresh.Food was not bad.Next morning we went to the restaurant serving breakfast somewhere down it was good set up and decent enough considering it was in the package as complimentary.MOST imp. Part of our stay was that the hotel was clean and safe for family. Jun 9 2008 just about ok We stayed at the Metro Heights as a part of an organised tour, so we had little info on the hotel beforehand. I wouldn't have booked the hotel if I had had any choice. On the other hand, the hotel wasn't the worst one we stayed in India, but that is not a lot. The room itself was reasonably clean (including the bathroom), and there was enough hot(tish) water, although the bathtub was cracked so that only showering was possible. However, the room (211 if I remember correctly) was quite basic and there was some noise from the street. There were no insects and the linen was clean, but I was also woken up in the middle of the night by an earbreaking buzzing noise when someone pressed the room doorbell for no reason.What I disliked the most was the staff. They were either absolutely indifferent to the needs and requests of their clients to the point of being rude or grovelingly polite in order to get a tip. No real service anywhere: you get things done if you ask, but no effort is made without you asking. The breakfast was a tired-looking buffet and the evening meal that we had there was not special in any way.The Karol Bagh area offers little for the tourist: all the sights and wonders of Delhi are at least a taxi ride away. In Karol Bagh, there is a bazaar and some shops, but overall nothing really interesting. It takes about 30 minutes in a moped-rickshaw to the Red Fort and slightly less to New Delhi (Connaught place). May 17 2008 OK We stayed at Hotel Metro Heights as part of an 'Intrepid' tour so had little choice in the booking of it. I think because we were part of a tour group we were reserved the worst rooms available!We stayed there at the start and end of our tour, although if we hadnt pre-booked as part of the tour we probably would have chosen not to go back.Our first room didnt have a window which struck us as a bit odd until we discovered that you have to pay extra for a window, even odder, never before had I considered windows as an unessential luxury! Although I guess one benefit of no window was that there were fewer traffic sounds to keep us awake. The second room we stayed in did have a window (after arguing with unhelpful staff) and was cleaner and larger but was next to the first floor office of the hotel so we were kept awake by the phone incessantly ringing and people shouting in the halls.All in all I think Hotel Metro Heights was fine but not great value for money, especially as it is out in Karol Bagh (not particularly central or interesting part of Delhi). The staff were largely unhelpful and the included breakfast left a lot to be desired. Cost approximately RS 2600 which I would say was daylight robbery for the level of service provided. If you shop around I'm sure you could get a lot more for your money. Jan 11 2008 avoid at all cost even when in packagedeal. This hotel, which offers room for 75 usd, but books through agents for only 20, we found to be a filthy dump. Any basic idea of hygiene is alien to them and on top of that not one staffmember is interested in the guest. Most rooms are mere cupboards with a bed, with no windows. Our first room, 208, was grimy to the hilt. Imagine a fan, black with soot, which splatters the fat dirt around your bathroom when turning. After a row and an intervention from our agent we moved to 106, which they 'cleaned' beforehand. Hot water is mostly off. Linen is dirty, the breakfastroom is disgusting as is the breakfast. We met groups of complaining people at all times of day. No sleep before 12pm, for the hotel is situated in the midst of the wholesale autotrade, hotelstaff starts banging around at 0530. Staff-sideentrance is open at all times, so no security at all on all floors. Dec 11 2007 Reception staff are awful This must have the worst reception staff ever. You could have up to 7 behind the counter (doing nothing) and yet it seems too much trouble to even acknowledge that a customer is waiting to ask a question.The hotel rooms appear dark and uninviting. There are many hotels in Karol Bagh so just go to one of the others and check out the rooms. Avoid this place if possible. Dec 8 2007 Returned later in trip and walked out. We had stayed here earlier in our trip. At that time we were given the promised room, number 111. However we were showed two new rooms this time as 111 was taken. The two new rooms were bad compared to 111. One room had the smell of sewage. The front desk could not find us a comfortable room. The front desk again refused to provide air conditioning. We were disappointed in the take it or leave it attitude which is becoming more prevalent in New Delhi with the paucity of hotel rooms. We chose not to support this behavior by staying here again, and we moved next door to the Hotel Singh Sahib. Dec 3 2007 Terrible Looks O.K at the main desk, but rooms are very average.We had to stay here twice, at the start of our trip and at the end a few weeks later, as it was already pre-booked.23 days in India at various hotels, but this was the worst.Hotel staff are unfriendly, and un co-operative, especially towards females.Only stay here if you must or if it is part of you tour package. Nov 29 2007 not metro heights Metro Heights.The ambience of a budget hotel but not a price to match.We walked into the foyer and thought this place looks ok, and that was as good as it got. Our room had water marks on the wall. The timber door frame in the bathroom was rotten and the air conditioner hardly worked.The day staff on the counter delivered a service that was akin to that of Faulty Towers where any request was received as an inconvenience. We asked for clean towels which arrived after 90 minutes and an additional request. A Request for an extra bed in the room took a couple of hours. To actually get the attention of the staff was an exercise in patience where we had to wait for them to stop watching the telly in the lobby or to stop chatting to their friends who would often drop by for a social visit. The location in Carolbahg is now in the middle of a car services area where every second shop seems to specialise in car speakers or window tinting. The meals were OK. We had a couple of breakfasts and a dinner which weren't overly expensive. The table cloths looked like the same ones that were on the table after we retuned from a fifteen day tour. Oct 27 2007 If you can afford book another hotel Metro Heights is sort of best-you-can-get in the lower price range (up to $ 75) in Delhi. It is simple, has dark rooms (the one we had did not even have windows) and especially on the ground floor you hear a lot of noise from the reception. Beds are ok but short, bathroom is clean but nothing fancy. This is a hotel for just sleeping, not to spent time there. Breakfast consist of a number of hot Indian dishes, toast and coffee/tea. A number of Dutch travel groups use the hotel, I think because they can't find anything better in that price range too. Jan 17 2007 Poor service at the Metro The Hotel Metro Heights, in Karolbagh, Delhi was our base in Delhi during our 3 week trip to India. This was my first trip to India, although my wife and her parents, whom we were travelling with, had visited before, so I kind of knew not to expect too much.The hotel itself is in a dusty busy side street some 15 minutes, by autorickshaw, from Connaught Place. It's within walking distance of the Karolbagh shopping areas, which is a bonus if you are into shopping.The rooms are okay. We stayed in three different rooms, on three different occassions as we were travelling and staying in other towns as well. The hotel kindly and safely kept a large number of our luggage that we did not require while travelling. The quality of the rooms vary. Some do not have bath tubs, while some do. Some are smaller than others. Generally the bathrooms and rooms are clean and tidy if not of the best quality.The problems:1) If you do not hand your key in when going out in the morning your room does not get made up!2) We were given damp pillow cases and towels the one night. The excuse being that due to it being winter, laundry does not dry!3) Breakfasts are appalling and is served in a dinghy basement that does not really encourage you to eat. We had requested a packed breakfast for one early morning start. Instead the hotel insisted that they would have a hot breakfast ready for us. This did not happen and we ended up eating just bread and a boiled egg.4) The overall service is just poor and they have to be pushed real hard to get anything done.5) Warm water is not hot water, a concept that this hotel just did not understand.6) The rooms can be quite noisy given it's location, there is a flyover quite close by. The staff are also noisy during their shift changes. They are also renovating some rooms and have a tendency to work till quite late unless you shout at the the night clerk.Stay here if you must but skip the breakfasts and be prepared for poor service. Dec 3 2006 Good place to stay in Karol Bagh The hotel is decently priced and closer to the main shopping strip in Karol Bagh; however, being a few blocks away ensures that the road noise is minimal.The Suites are around $75 including breakfast and are quite large. The service has been better than other hotels and when the internet access was not working, they called someone in on a Sunday to check it out.I would stay here again. Nov 26 2005 cheap and good for a night We chose this place to be near the train station as we flew in at midnight and needed to catch a 7am train.the room was small but he A/c worked and the twin beds were clean and not too hard. The shower was not totally clean, but for our 5 hours, it was fine. Only problem was that we couldn't find the hallway lightswitch and it was dark trying to leave the hotel!Can't comment on the veiws or location, as we were too tired and it was our first night in India.Paid $40 for the double.

Feb 5 2008 Omni hotel did not honor reservation I reserved a superior room for one night through the Venere travel agency.(They had all my credit card information) When I arrived at the hotel at 2:00A.M.after the 20 hour trip from New York City I was told the hotel was filled and could not stay there.I was offered a room at another hotel which I declined. My voucher for the room for the night was deemed meaningless. An Iranian Tour operator was also having a problem with arrangements that had been made months before. A reservation at the hotel might be honored if no one else takes your room before you arrive.I would warn you against staying at a hotel run by such shabby people. Jan 14 2008 Not a hotel but a hole I'm working in India for a couple of weeks and decided to visit Delhi. BCDTravel from India booked the hotel. The place is just terrible. The area in where it is is awful, you feel like you're going to get killed the moment you put a feet outside the hotel (I know in general the zones in India don't look good, but really this is one of the worst areas there). The rooms are very dirty, smells, i even found 10 empty bottles of beer in front of my room when i arrived (no one worried to at least throw them at that moment) and also when o left the next day. Don't follow the tramp of the pictures, they must be edited because it's not like the pictures at all. The rate for a hotel like this should be less than US$10, not more. Sep 13 2007 value for money i booked my hotel from the website and i made the payment from ther and i wa scared that the hotel is good enough or not but when i reached the airport i was welcomed like a person of my family has came to recive me and it was of a different class and when i reached the hotel it was like i have paid nothing for the hotel ppl say that that it is value for money but i will say it was more than value for money one difficulty i experienced that was i was that tv cabel was not working for 2 hour or so but later it was corrected so i will recamend each and everybody to visit this hotel and the hotel website is [--] Aug 19 2007 No I don't want to go to Agra. I am used to staying at inexpensive Indian hotels as well as Western style hotels in India. Usually, the Indian hotels above a certain price range (like more than US$15/night) are fine with some shabbiness in the facilities. Other than the bathroom, my room was clean and comfortable, and even the bathroom was okay if not spotless. They provided a kettle and some instant coffee/tea too (although the mug was dirty with dried coffee inside.) The hotel has free (!) wireless Internet, a real convenience. But I would never stay here again because it's pretty clear it's a scam for the travel agency that owns/is partnered with it.I should have known when I arrived this place was into fleecing people. I tipped the guy who carried my bags. Later, he hunted me down because the bill was 'ripped'. I know that India has this wierd thing about bills not being legal tender if they are ripped, but there's apparently some exchange process where you take the old bill to a bank and they'll replace it, and this bill was ancient, but intact--not actually ripped. I'm 90% sure this guy brought the bill back because he thought he deserved a bigger tip, and of course since I didn't have any other small bills of the same denomination, I did give him a bigger tip. I wouldn't do that now.Can I just say, I am sooooo sick of the following sequence of questions:1. Sir, where are you from? What is your good name? 2. How long are you in staying in Delhi? (answer, 2 days)3. Have you ever been to India? (yes, 5 times)4. What are you doing today? (ummm, some work, maybe going to visit some friends)5. Would you like a package tour to the Taj Mahal in Agra? (or the more forceful 'you *would* like a package tour to the Taj Mahal.') And usually a refusal to take no for an answer.I was asked _seven_ times to go to the Taj by the hotel staff--desk clerks, bellhop, including one extended conversation in which they claimed there was some problem with my hotels.com reservation, then took me to a travel agency a block away to have them 'check my reservation' and 'give feedback to the management' and three guys took turns trying to sell me tours. The next day I get an unscheduled wakeup call. I'm dead asleep, a call to the room wakes me up, and he asks about my 'hotel voucher,' &quot;I gave you the reservation sheet yesterday&quot;, &quot;What are you doing today?&quot;, &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;, &quot;You should go to Agra today&quot;, I slam down the phone. Even just leaving the hotel, the desk clerk stops me, asks my room number, then interrogates me about my plans again (same guy as that morning on the phone? I don't know). I'm used to touts. But the hotel staff honestly seem to think I owe them a booking on some overpriced tour. It's like one of those condo timeshare sales pitches that lasts your entire stay in the hotel. Never again will I stay here!Checking out was more of the same. Again with the upselling. So first they get all huffy, and they're like &quot;you have to pay at check out!&quot; Um, yes, I normally expect that at a hotel. But again they are frustrated because my 'voucher' is not a voucher, but a reservation through hotels.com (not prepaid, in this case.) Okay, so I try to pay. Despite the lovely lucite stand sitting on the check in desk saying &quot;We accept visa/master/american express&quot; they refuse to take my card. &quot;Well we don't take cards for such a small amount.&quot; Yeah, like $80 is too small an amount to charge--in India, where I've seen merchants set minimum charge amounts near $2. And it's not like it's some old decal stuck in a place where it can't be removed, or some sponsored sign that has other information on it. It's a brand new sign sitting on the desk that says only that they take the credit cards. Okay, I'll pay cash. Then they refuse to give me a receipt. And the reason? Because they say my internet reservation is my receipt! I just hand this guy a wad of cash, and he's telling me the same piece of paper I had before I paid is now proof of payment. I pushed the issue and got upset, and refused to leave until I had a receipt (fearing that they would then charge my credit card used in the reservation as well and claim they'd never received the cash.) Again with the trip to the travel agency around the corner to speak to the 'management'. He says 'we'll have to charge you more if you get a receipt. We have to include luxury tax then.' and I say 'and you would have cheated the government of the tax otherwise?' The guy says again and again, &quot;we are very honest, how would we stay in business otherwise?&quot; Right after admitting to me he's stealing from the public coffers. And again with the upselling. &quot;Where are you going now? You should just hire a car for the day, only 1100 rupees.&quot; In the end the ride to the airport cost me 500, even though my Indian friend had taken the same ride, also booked through the hotel, the previous day for 350. As I'm getting into the car, the hotel guy says 'well it's 500 for the ride, but 600 if you want A/C'. Well fine then, I don't want A/C. I spend half the ride arguing. Driver tries to sell me on how great the A/C is, then he tries to pull the &quot;I am but a humble servant, and it's so hot, won't you please pay for A/C? Please sir! Please!&quot; I know full well he's getting 150% of the real fare, and I'm not gonna pay him one paisa more on the bait and switch. I tell him if he wants the A/C so badly he should pay the 100 rupees (and he'd still be making more than normal off me!). At this point it's not the money, it's the principle of the thing with the hidden charges etc. I've had to yell at three people from the hotel just to get them to leave me alone. And in approximately 5 months of traveling in India over a period of several years, I've had to resort to yelling when someone just wouldn't take no for an answer only twice before this hotel--once with a beggar who tried to stop me from walking down the sidewalk by blocking my path for about 10 minutes straight, and once with a dishonest internet cafe host.Please, please don't even bother trying this hotel. Karol Bagh is full of comparable hotels at generally lower prices that don't come with a fulltime harrassment program. Dec 26 2006 Hotel Omni is not a hotel I got hotel booked from my indian partners &amp; this is the worst hotel I've every stayed in! I happened to stay here last month &amp; everything from the service to the rooms were just terrible. The first thing you'll notice would be the smell of damp linen... everything from the bed sheets to pillows stunk with the smell. Check In system was horrible . I left the next morning since it was late in the night and staying in a neighbouring much cheaper, but much cleaner and nicer hotel! I didn't get enough time in India to be able to get the hotel closed, but if I ever do this is the first thing I would do! Dec 9 2006 Feel like 5 star hotel. Excellent place to live!

We had two different rooms - one at the back looking towards the mosque and another on Asif Ali road side. This is a reasonably budget hotel located on the edge of Old Delhi. The rooms we stayed in were of an acceptable standard -not exactly luxurious but you get what you pay for. The air-con worked (which in July was essential). The bathroom was clean. We had a friend who stayed in a single room which did not have a window - which would have been a bit depressing. So watch out for that.I would agree with other reviewers that the hotel is noisy. If you're at the back you get the call to prayer from 2 mosques. At the front there is the incessant beeping of Delhi traffic. The best thing about the hotel was the restaurant - which has won awards for kashmiri food recently. The bar upstairs was pretty grim though - no window and therefore smelled stale. Jun 19 2009 good place It was anice place to stay. You could enjoy a nice place to live as well as a nice location to wander about. So, i liked the place while my stay with some of my friends.We had a great time out there. Jun 8 2009 Veeeeeeery noisy... I would never go back to sleep, I would go back for dinner, the restaurant is very nice, the staff is helpful, however the hotel is very old, and being wakep up by the mosque every morning at 6 am is not my cup of tea. Mar 11 2009 quite surprising It's not a particularly quiet hotel to be honest. We seemed to be lucky in that we got one of the rooms in the back with a view of the Mosque which was entertaining. It's a beautifully furnished hotel and has a certain old world charm to it.The service we received was quite good. We had to leave at 7:30 to continue onto Agra and the staff very kindly gave us some breakfast (we were a bit too early for the buffet breakfast).Thugs Bar is also quite fun :) We wanted to try the restaurant in the hotel as well but didn't get there (going by all accounts its meant to be fantastic!) Sep 21 2008 Two weeks at the Broadway I stayed at the Broadway for the last two weeks of July 2008 with a large group. My room was on the top floor, at the back overlooking the Jama Masjid. My sense is that the quality of the rooms varies a bit. The folks in front complained of traffic noise, particularly those on the lower floors. There are also rooms in the middle of the hotel that have no exterior windows, just opaque glass facing the corridor. You must get used to it, because no one seemed to complain about this. My room was lovely. It was very light, small but clean and bright. The bathroom had ample water pressure and hot water, though the shower usually took a minute to warm up. The air conditioning was quite powerful, maybe a touch too cold. It is true that the hallways have no AC vents, but enough cold air vents from the rooms to keep the halls relatively comfortable.The staff were prompt in providing room service, and kept the rooms clean over the two weeks. They did not pester us at all, but that may be because there was no point in pestering a group or because the hotel was full, so they were making money any way. Laundry was cheap, and returned same day, but be careful with delicate fabrics, as most drying in India is done by Iron (and sometimes the laundry did come back a bit damp). The mosque behind the hotel does call the neighborhood to prayer in the early morning, but I found this charming. Sometimes I woke up and listened drowsily before rolling over and going back to sleep, and sometimes I didn't wake up at all. On weekends all of the children of the neighborhood get out on the roof tops and fly kites. From our room we could literally see hundreds of them. Also on the weekends on the street in front of the hotel there is a used book fair. My sense is that if you are looking for a hotel that is inexpensive and not in Paharganj, the Broadway is a good bet. The attached photos show our room. There are also pictures that earlier posters added of a room decorated by a French designer who stayed at the hotel. Fear not, almost all of the rooms in the hotel share our decor and not the loud multicolor decor of that room.As for food, we ate breakfast in Chor Bizarre every morning. The breakfast buffet was was more than adequate, though the restaurant was a bit dim for a morning meal. Every morning featured hard boiled eggs as well as either omlettes or fried eggs. Also at least one curry, cereal, toast, juice, tea or coffee, and on some days fried veggie cutlets or samosas. There was fruit juice and they will bring bananas on request. It is true that there was no other fresh fruit, but this is India. We were also fed lunch in a conference room, which gave us a sample of what the kitchen can do. Suffice it to say that lunch was generally excellent, and I'm sure that those eating at the restaurant for lunch or dinner would agree. As for the bar, Thugs, yes, it is a bit of a dive. Who wants to go to India to drink?As for location, a tuktuk to CP or New Delhi station/paharganj cost 60 Rs. The Muslim neighborhoods behind the hotel are interesting to walk in, but better to go in a group. I saw no obvious dangers, but one of our more intrepid members did come down with a nasty virus.The Broadway is not the lap of luxury. But it is a solid mid range hotel in the heart of Delhi that exceeded my expectations and is definitely better than most of the reviews here would indicate. Sep 9 2008 Disgusted with Broadway hotel Delhi I stayed here in a mixture of rooms for approx 4 nights - 2 nights in cheaper rooms which were dirty, noisy and old so upgraded to most expensive rooms at front which had been refurbished for far greater price only to find out that they too were noisy (as all rooms are adjoining with thin wooden internal door so you can hear everything from other rooms), no hot water for days, sheets covered in human hair. A complete arogance by staff and careless attitude of management when we complained. The bar is seedy as they come, food overpriced and general hotel over-rated. Were going to stay 2 weeks but left after 4 nights. I was sick of being harrassed daily by staff to buy a service from them either a taxi, a tour, a driver etc - even being told it was dangerous to go out alone, rubbish! Wouldnt return here ever, save your money and go elsewhere where they want your business and treat you like a guest rather than an inconvenience. Aug 31 2008 jack hammer broadway I read all the reviews and tried to keep an open mind. I have stayed in some hell holes. So I was ready for anything. I was even ready for the bully attempt to make you buy expensive tour packages or when leaving finding added charges you did not make. So we arrived at the airport and please try to remember to go over to the front entrance of the airport ,thats where the taxi they send will pick you up. When we arrived in the lobby everything went smoothly I was so surprise. They took us up to our room where the hall was cluttered with carts I got worried until we entered the room. spacious beautiful bathroom. comfortable large bed.tv. loved it. overlooked the mosque enjoyed call to prayer. The only thing that was not so great was the work that was going on in the mornings the sounds of jack hammers. but after a while you tend to ignore it. the area is rather disappointing but cabs are plentiful. the resteraunt chor Bizarre was very busy and the food seemed more for tourist but there are really good vegetarian places only a few blocks away. I totally would go back ,really enjoyed my stay. Jul 6 2008 Hotel Broadway We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Broadway. The room was OK (the view was nice, but the room was quite noisy), the breakfast was great and the staff were very friendly. We ate at the restaurant (Chor Bizarre) several times and really loved everything we ordered, in particular the gulab jamun. Mar 5 2008 Common areas look great ...... This hotel was booked as part of a package tour of Rajasthan and Agra. It lived up to most of the reviews - an average sort of place. The common areas were quite clean and attractive, including the breakfast room. The room itself was fairly large, with twin beds, and nicely appointed. It looks like the furniture and fixtures were recevently updated, although the walls were stained. The bathroom shower sprayed a fine mist, but the vent vents into the hallway, so not only is your privacy compromised, but you'll also hear everyone / everything in the hallway. The room was not well insulated, so we could hear honking horns all day and all night as well as the barking and howling dogs. For those in need of English language television, there are about 80 cable stations of India and English language programming. The airconditioner worked, but the heater seemed a bit lacking, so ask for extra blankets if you're cold.The breakfast was pretty skimpy - toast, thin oatmeal, hardboiled eggs, bread, potatoes, artificial juice, tea and coffee. On the second day, fried eggs were also available, as well as cold cereals. The cleanliness was a bit suspect as we saw the staff wipe the used plates and cutlery and replace them on the table ...... using the same cloth that just wiped off the table ! However, perhaps because it was the start of our trip, this lack of cleanliness did not have an immediate effect on our digestive system (that would come later in the trip).We didn't get a chance to eat dinner there, although the guides and drivers remarked that the food was supposed to be quite good.The front desk staff was accommodating in making change for us and made us feel welcome. Feb 16 2008 Inexpensive and just OK My son and I had dinner at the hotel's much praised restaurant, Chor Bizarre, in 2004. It was outstanding, a Mughal feast. For that reason I decided to stay at the Broadway on my solo October 2007 visit. I thought I might take all my meals at the Chor.The restaurant was a diappointment. Breakfast offered just two kinds of eggs -- scrambled one day, hard boiled the next -- and few other dishes. The entrees I ordered at lunch and dinner were good, not great.My single room had one window: it looked out onto a corridor. Actually, my two rooms. Without explanation the staff moved me after two nights -- to the room next door.My first room was designed to appeal to a six-year-old. Its curtains were decorated with cartoon characters, as was its bedspread and other items and parts of the room. Since the bed was a single, I wondered if many young children checked in alone.Aside from a bed, the room also had a chair and table (the latter attached to a wall), a small closet, a full-length mirror (decorated with cartoon characters), and a safe.The bathroom was quite modern -- and also very cramped.The Broadway's location is a bit distant from Connaught Circle -- about half-way between Connaught Circle and Old Delhi -- but since Delhi is so spread out, that's not really a disadvantage.A clear advantage is price: having paid between US$200 and US$300 on my previous trip, the Broadway's US$80 rate was quite welcome. Feb 10 2008 Great location I've just spent a couple of days at the Broadway. It's on Asaf Ali Rd right next to Delhi gate and is ideally located for exploring Old Delhi,Jama Masjid and the Red Fort. All the drivers seem to know it so you'll have no trouble with directions.I had room 14 - a single room which was windowless. It was, however, clean and the bathroom was well equipped with regular clean towels. It's a bit basic, I suppose, and you couldn't call it luxurious but the downstairs restaurant is excellent and always busy with Indians and foreigners alike. Staff were likeable enough and more than happy to arrange pick-ups and suchlike.Would I stay there again? - mmmmm, dunno. At that price range I dare say it's fair value for Delhi but it was a wee bit characterless. Feb 4 2008 It smells bad!!! We were 9 persons staying at this hotel for some days.I booked there because I had read about it in a Lonley Planet Guide, but we did not like it because:- The single room had no window!- Outside our room there was a mosque (very noisy very, very early in the morning!!)- The staff was not very friendly or helpfull.- Yes, the rooms had A/C but the corridor and the lift were hot!- But most of all: Everywhere there was a very bad smell....But when all this is said I have to add that the location was good. We walked in the small streets behind the hotel and it was near several places - we could go by rickshaw or Tuk-Tuk in a few minutes.I will not recommend this hotel - it must be easy to find a better one! Jan 17 2008 value for money this hotel was good value, not luxurious but good size room, good shower room, nice and clean, clean sheets and towels, attatched to chor bizzarre restaurant which is very nice! Nov 27 2007 Cheap but not again I got a good price, and didn't have that high expectations. If I had been staying for longer I would have asked for another room. I got a a windowless room, which is the dirtiest hotel room I've ever received. With a cockroach, previous guests hair, dust, and so on. The bed was very hard. And the door had a huge gap under neath so all sounds in the corridor could be heard. There was also a call too prayer at sun rise. I slept very poorly the 2 nights in the hotel. But I've also heard from the other guests that there is a big difference in the rooms. So be sure to check what you get. That said they were very helpful. They organized breakfast before opening hours for me and a tour group. I was slightly worried about eating in the Chor Bizzare restaurant, given the cleaning level in my room. But it was excellent, with very nice staff, and good food. Try the saffron, semolina desert. This was in the hight of turist season with a Indian Pakistan cricket match, and a lot of fairs in Delhi so all the hotels where rather full. Nov 24 2007 Quirky clean and comfortable When we arrived at the Broadway early in the morning we were shown to room 26. This room had clean beds and clean bathroom facilities with reasonable aircon. Other than that it was pretty shabby. When we had slept and got up to go out of the hotel, the receptionist advised that our 'superior room' was now ready. We were shown to a very smart room, spotlessly clean (room 22) at the front. It felt like we were in a different hotel. It's worth checking to see what room you are in. The road outside however, at the front, was really noisy. Vehicles going all night. On balance it was a great place to stay. I can't comment on the value for money as it was part of an inclusive deal. The restaurant was good, always busy, you need to book yourself a table. Breakfast included a choice of hot food and the usual toast, cereal etc. The staff were a little stiff (in that slightly brusque Indian kind of way) but after a couple of days they were really friendly. Prices for the phone and room service were cheap, i'd expect to be paying over the top in Delhi. Sep 30 2007 Not a good experience I booked this hotel after reading the one good review on tripadvisor and reading in various guidebooks that this hotel was a good value. I disagree. Although the hotel succeeded in providing us with a reliable pickup at the airport (we then used that driver for our tour of the Golden Triangle) for what we paid we did not get a good value. The hotel placed us in a room that was next door to a room that was being gutted. This meant we were woken up at 8:00 am every morning while we were on holiday by hammering, men talking, and sounds of drywall and plaster coming down three feet from us. After looking into the room next door, it was apparent that we were sleeping next to potentially unhygenic conditions, there was a pile of trash, drywall, plaster, and cement blocks in the room.Breakfast was less than desirable, the restaurant was dark and gloomy with a buffet that was questionably fresh. Suprising coming from such a highly rated restaurant, Chor Bizarre. Needless to say we did not eat dinner there. The area is convenient for sightseeing around Old Delhi but honestly it doesn't matter as you should hire a driver while in New Delhi to alleviate yourself from the frustration of traffic and getting ripped off by taxis and rickshaws.Overall we would not return to this hotel. The hotel room was clean, but given the conditions of the room next door (two feet from our beds) I would not pay US$100 for this room. It was worth perhaps US$30 at the most. Apr 12 2007 Great little hotel Stayed at the Broadway hotel for two nights on arriving in Delhi, after reading good reports about it in the Lonely Planet guide. Its very close to the Red Fort, and Chandni Chowk ( a maze of narrow streets and alleyways full of shops and Indian life.) The rooms in the hotel are clean , with air-con, and very good bathrooms. Times of India delivered to your door every morning. The front desk changes money at a reasonable rate. The famous &quot;Chore Bizarre&quot; restaurant lives up to it's name, excellent food, wine and service!! There's even an antique car on which breakfast is served from! The &quot;Thugs&quot; bar serves just about anything you can think of. It wasn't the Ritz, but a very good value 3 star hotel. I paid about £20 for the room and a decent breakfast. All in all, a great little hotel. Nov 10 2009 ??????????

Nov 23 2009 In Delhi you often get less than what you pay for and at this hotel .... much less I had a 26 hour layover in Delhi, ugh, and I wanted a hotel that was clean, with Wi/Fi where I could crash for the night. This hotel has wi/fi but it is not what the photos portray. The photos that the hotel uses for promotion totally fail to capture what you get at this hotel. Go to Tripadvisor for photos of those who actually stayed here. This hotel is very old and run down. In the room the ceiling fan is too loud to run and to turn off the lamp next to the bed you have to unscrew the bulb. There are stains on the sheets which show that cleanliness is not part of this manager\\'s mentality. The fuzzy TV works but the remote doesn\\'t .... I hope you are getting the picture. The words that come to mind are: grimy, tacky and overpriced for what you get. Finally, outside, where the hotel is located, is blighted, noisy and remote. Conclusion... there has to be better property\\'s for just a night than this. Nov 21 2009 Really enjoyed i been to this hotel in this month only, and find it worth it for money, check-in take just 3-4min to get our rooms, housekeeping manager is really helpful, all the staff members are really nice n helping . even there travel desk is very helpful for us.Awesome nad enjoyable trip!!!! gr8t memories Nov 21 2009 Average The hotel is located in a very busy, noisy and rowdy area. For those who love shopping, it is ideal. However, the staff are curteous and always at one\\'s service. The rooms are neat, the food is satisfactory. The Tour company Abyss Tours lived up to expectation. On my next trip, God willing, even if i don\\'t stay in the hotel, i will still employ the services of Abyss Tours. Nov 21 2009 Very Clean Comfortable and Firendly The hotel is well positioned, the staff are very friendly and fell over themselves to organise trips for us.Rafiq Khan who operates through the hotel for Indian Tribal Tours arranged for us to have a driver for the say to enable us to see all the sights in the safe knowledge of having a car waiting for us.Lovely friendly people and I owuld recommend both the hotel and people higlhly to all. Nov 19 2009 not recommended The air con make so much noise that you can’t even get a nap for 5minutes not recommended. Room is ok but all fixtures are old. Nov 16 2009 DO NOT COME HERE “OVERPRICED” FOR ITS QUALITY A normal hotel which is on the road with lot of traffic noise allnight. They took $70 from me which is overpriced for the service andthe kind of room which was given to me. Why I am saying this becausewhen I went to a nearby hotel(this area is full of hotels). I got amuch better quality and service at 40$ had they given me good andclean towel (they took 30 minutes give me dirty towels) probably Iwould have not checked out and came to know the difference. Nov 12 2009 Excellent budget hotel in Delhi The hotel arranged to meet &amp; collect us from New Delhi Railway station at 6.30am, and we were transferred efficiently to the hotel. Check in was friendly &amp; efficient &amp; we got a free upgrade. The room was spacious enough, everything worked fine &amp; the included breakfast was very good. I would highly recomment this place for anyone passing through Delhi. Nov 10 2009 Not Worth It This hotel is in a very busy are. There are many hotels nearly. Therecharges are higher and services are not at all good. We checked out ofthe hotel next morning and the reception took 30 minutes to check usout. The bill was not ready and excuse was that there is someconfusion. If I had a flight to catch, I would have missed it. Nov 9 2009 Open lobby... This hotel has its reception area open to a very undesirable tour operator (who walks about the hotel giving the impression he is a hotel employee) who attempts to sell you a golden triangle tour for a very high price. Of greater concern is the fact this man somehow manged to find what room we where in, and infact made an internal telephone call to our room to attempt to arrange to meet us to sell his tour services. I wonder if the hotel is taking a commission for this? He was present in the hotel lobby bothering the tourists on all 3 days we where there. His office is around the corner from the hotel, and he will attempt to take you there to do a hard sell. Despite this negative first impression, the food was great as was its price, service could be better. Hotel pick up was relaible. Front of house staff attentive, but aloof at times. Air conditioning was not working in our room and it took over 2 hrs to relocate us. The drains are very smelly and the room had a musty smell to it . Generally clean and well presented. No window in either room so no natural light. Nov 9 2009 Decent Hotel Good Location This hotel was just fine. Its a little pricey but then so are all hotels in Delhi. We arrived having booked in advance and check in was very smooth. In the first room given the toilet leaked so we asked to move. This was not a problem as other rooms were available. The second room was just fine. Rooms are on the dark side but they are clean and comfortable with satelite TV, Air Con and a Fan. Also we had a fridge which is always nice in such hot tempretures. Hot water only worked in the morning. I like the neighborhood of Karol Bagh. Its in a local Indian Market for Sarees mostly so its interesting to walk around and you dont get hassled too much (comparatively). I always felt safe here. The metro is a 10 minute walk if you want to get around independantly. Also there is always a AutoRickshaw Driver to hand to haggle with. You are close enough to all the attractions by these transports. I would recommend this hotel. Nov 3 2009 A lotus in a market and traffic pond As i am aregular visiter to delhi due to metro project, this time i made the booking through web and finaly landed to clark which is located in a busy street, But was realy surperised once we enter, it was really cutting you from outer busy environment to clean atmosphere where you can easily relax in clean rooms, staff was realy helpful, free breakfast and free pick up from airport is really a big advantage, will visit again in november, thanks to there hospitality. Oct 30 2009 liasoning with wrong people Me my wife stayed here for a good 3 days good. Rooms were not that bad but not that good too. Breakfast was average. High price for hotel like this, they have arrangement with bad travel agents and they took almost more than double price for a tour to agra, jaipur. We know from our friends who did same tour in quiet fewer prices, car and hotel were same. Rippled off. Oct 19 2009 More than you Expect Our travel agent booked this hotel for 1 night but we arrived very late at night there and ended up to book 1 more night directly at the front desk who were very polite,gentle and helpfull always...Next day mor ning after our breakfast we were planning to get around the city but had no idea what to do in an unfamilliar place at the same time Mr.Chokerborthy introduced us with a man in the lobby named Mr.Zargar who arranged some part of our trip around Rajasthan for 10 days &amp; got to see alot more in such a short time.The service is ok &amp; most of the time we had our meals on the rooftop restaurant with quality dishes.Breakfast in the morning could be better with some other choices but no complaint at all we got what we asked for.I recommend this hotel for any travler bcoz they do care for others no matter how old you are. Oct 12 2009 Friendly clean and safe Airport pick was very helpful. Little expansive but Delhi\\'s hotels are expansive compare to other cities. Use travel sites to get good deal. Sep 24 2009 Excellent Oasis in the heart of the New Delhi\\' We had previously experienced a great rooftop meal here- and decided that we would stay here on this trip to Delhi. We weren\\'t disappointed! We got a very good deal/rate through Expedia to spend a week at this great hotel. The rooms were small but well presented and exceptionally clean- complete with comfortable bed, wifi and complimentary toiletries. The rooftop restaurant served excellent breakfasts (recommended the on-demand omelettes and coffee) and no fuss late evening meals/refreshments were delicious.All staff were attentive and helpful- any small niggles were dealt with efficiently with a smile.The hotel is situated right in the heart of the Karol Bagh district of New Delhi- a fantastic place to get a feel for real street life. With a large local market at the end of the street and the superb Suruchis (thali) restaurant only two streets way we were never stuck for places to discover by foot.Highly recommended. We will be back. Sep 23 2009 Wonderful Stay I booked an executive room in this hotel for a one night stay, which included an airport pickup. First i was bit worried about the airport pickup but was glad to see a car to pick me up at the airport, however had to pay the driver extra to turn on the AC. The room was clean (though small in size) including the linen. The staff were friendly and all queries were looked ater. Will definately recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay.And yes the bed is amazing! Sep 10 2009 good and clean i stay 3 nights and person of the hotel was very nice , and the rooms are very clean , food good too... The travel desk of the hotel very helpful &amp; friendly Mr. Rafiq &amp; Mr. Haroon. Aug 29 2009 Really helpful staff and central location The staff at the front desk were really helpful and gave great directions to the various places I wanted to go to. The room while not large was still well kept. I was also pleasantly surprised by the open rooftop breakfast area/restaurant. I got to Delhi by myself and the hotel provided a free pickup at the airport and I felt pretty comfortable in and around the area as a single female traveller and was only later joined by my friend. Aug 27 2009 The smells noise and heat of Delhi with the bliss and escapism of the hotel. Fab hotel - possibly a bit pricier than some in Delhi - £30 a night, but a lap of luxury when off the plane, and trying to find your feet. Very comfortable, great food, but mostly, excellent service and friendly! Aug 27 2009 Nice Hotel; Grotty area My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in August 2009 and were pretty pleased overall. The hotel is lovely inside, the room was spacious, the A/C worked, the restaurant was pleasant and the staff were more than helpful. The bathroom was somewhat grubby but that is a recurrent problem throughout India.The only thing that lets the hotel down is its location. Karol Bagh isn\\'t a clean, Westernised area like the areas that house some of the 5 star hotels; it\\'s dirty and congested and there\\'s a good chance of stepping in something unpleasant as you leave the hotel.The nearest Metro station is only 5 minutes walk away though and it\\'s only a couple of stops to Connaught Place Aug 14 2009 Great value hotel lovely rooms - peace in the mayhem of Delhi! This is great little hotel which has great value. Breakfast is included in the price and is very good. We had food in the restaurant one evening and despite being the only ones there, the food was very good! The rooms were really comfortable and clean.We booked to stay there again at the very end of our trip and we got the most gorgeous room with a bath and fabulous shower. Loved this hotel - location is not the best but would definitely stay here again. Jul 23 2009 Top value in a good location We are sat in the foyer as I write this review. We are only staying for two nights and booked on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews. It represents excellent value at around 20 pounds per night. The room isn\\'t quite as spacious as the photos suggest and are well used. The room is clean and the aircon works (a must in Delhi in July). If you are used to 3 star European hotels you may be a little disappointed with the first impression, but things are different in India!The staff are numerous and very helpful. The restaurant is very good. As the previous reviewer points out, the breakfast is a little strange but they make a good omelette. For dinner we had an excellent mixed tandoori for two, which with lashings of (very strong) beer came to around 6 pounds each. The best curry sauce I\\'ve ever had!The district is lively, with miles of streets with small shops and street vendors. It\\'s noisy all day as all drivers seem to beep constantly. Be prepared to have to haggle for just about everything! It\\'s assumed (I think) that tourists are very wealthy and will pay anything!In summary - this hotel provides an excellent base for exploring Delhi. Jul 22 2009 Would recommend for the price Stayed at the hotel with wife and 3 year old and got a king size bed as asked for. Room was a decent size and quality was ok without being extraordinary. Had breakfast at the hotel and the choice was a bit of a let down, had spicy noodles and pasta amongst eggs and toast! But for the price we paid you couldnt complain. The area around the hotel is very noisy and if your a light sleeper like me then that will be a problem, my wife though was fine. The upside of this is that there is a good market at night in the area for some shopping. For food we ate at Pizza Hut round the corner but beware of taxi drivers in the area as when we asked for directions he said its 5 miles away and a 100 ruppee ride. We happily declined. In short you could pay a lot more in Delhi for not much more. Jun 27 2009 not great but good We booked our stay at Hotel Clark International before we left home which turned out to be smart because we met other guests who said that they booked by going to the hotel once in Delhi and they were charged double what we paid. Overall, my b-f and I had a good stay here. We got free pick-up from the airport and the hotel was in a good location, but the drawbacks were that there was construction happening on the rooftop which woke us up in the a.m., they tried to charge us for items n the fridge we didn\\'t drink, and phone calls were pricey. One of the major pitfalls against this place was that the staff wasn\\'t all that helpful. When we asked if they had a map of the area we could have, we were told to follow a man in the lobby who would get us one. We were then taken to a travel agency who tried to talk us into booking tours to Agra and sight seeing around Delhi. They also charged way more for a lift to the airport than a taxi actually cost. Our room was spacious and clean (although the washroom was a little dingy and the TV was broken). The bed was comfortable and the AC worked. The breakfast that was included was ok. May 12 2009 Excellent Choice We were a bit concerned over the mixed reviews, especially of those who booked their rooms via Expedia and subsequent problems they encountered. The Expedia rate is almost 1/2 the price of the published rack rates, so it was hard to resist!We booked (and prepaid) via Expedia a premium room. Our international flight was due to arrive at 12:30AM but was over an hour late. I had reconfirmed our flight arrival details with the hotel along with our room reservations about a week before we were due to arrived.We were very pleased (and grateful!) that the hotel &quot;boy&quot; was smiling and waiting for us at the airport and whisked us away to the hotel. Check-in was a snap, with only a quick stop at the front desk so they could photocopy our passport info then off to the room.We could not be have been more pleasantly surprised. The bed was awesomely comfortable, the room, (on the 3rd floor) was clean, neat and modern. Plenty of hot water. The tiny window provided no view, but hey, who comes to Delhi for the view?Breakfast was included in the rate) and was satisfactory. We also ate dinner there the first night and it was very good. Watch out for the high alcholic content of the Kingfisher beer however! It is a real kick in the pants:) It\\'s not in the polished area in Delhi, but an interesting neighborhood with a colorful market. It\\'s only a couple blocks from the metro. The autorickshaw drivers in the area were a bit annoying but that\\'s Delhi.You will need earplugs. I think earplugs were invented specifically for India. Between the barking dogs and honking of horns, it\\'s a wonder anyone gets any sleep!If you look for an good value hotel in Delhi, and don\\'t want to spend over $100.00 a night, this is an excellent choice. The staff was polite and helpful, but not effusive. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return here. May 9 2009 Value for money I booked the Hotel for a stopover before my international flight. I was coming from Goa and got the Hotel details here in this site. After deciding to go for it , I got a reservation through hotels.co.in for a Premium Room+Airport Pickup+Internet for US$36. That was pretty good I think . I although my flight from Goa was delay the boy from the Hotel was there waiting me and took me safely to the city. The place is busy, but the hotel seemed nice at first. After I checked in, the boy took me to my room and as soon as he opened the door I noticed it was a standard room. Immediatly upon calling the reception and explaining that my booking was for a premium room the moved me. The room was nice and clean, but the bathroom although clean was a bit run down. The food at the restaurant was ok and the breakfast, although simple, was ok too. They charged me INR$600 to take me to the airport the next day.Anyway, it was all right ... and the price was ok, so I think I can recommend the Hotel. May 7 2009 Centrally located Gud option if you are travelling on a tight budget May 6 2009 A welcome sight after travelling! We booked our stay her for the first few nights in Delhi and then wandered around looking at some of the other hotels in the loney planet but nothing was a patch on this one so we ended up returning two more times! The staff were always welcoming and there was a real sense of safety. We booked through Expedia and then directly through the hotel for the other two stays. Expedia was half the price of the published price but the hotel happily gave us the same rate for our other stays. The rooms were clean with LCD TV and really comfortably pillows! (The rooms on the 3rd floow seemed a little more modern than those on the 2nd) There were no windows in the cheaper rooms. Breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant and is included in the price. The hotel is situated in a busy shopping area with coffee shops, Pizza Hut and McDonalds nearby (just in case u get a case of Delhi Belly as we did!) There are also loads of other local choices. When booking travel use the agent across the road from the hotel, he really looked after us and was nearly half the price of the guy hanging around the hotel lobby! There\\'s an internet cafe nearby so everything you need! Easy to catch a rickshaw a travel around. Would definitely recommend! Apr 21 2009 So-So I had a few occasions to stay at the hotel once in sept 2008 and once more in nov 2008. There are a few things that i liked about the hotel and few that probably, in my opinion was a little bit of a let down. The things i really liked : room ambience, room cleanliness, hospitable staff, top floor open air restaurant, proximity to market place and metro station, food(taste). the let downs: room service - sometimes took ages, food was little spicy,lack of variety in food choices, AC- almost non functional, room size, tv(still CRT) in some rooms. I noticed the lack of variety in food since i was staying for a longer period of time being on a business trip..for ppl staying overnight or just for a day or two, it might not be bad at all. I could see lot of foreign tourists stayin there...If someone is looking for a decent acco in karolbagh area , would recommend to try this one. Apr 3 2009 Great modern and low cost with exceptional service My sister and I staye dat this hotel for a business purpose. The staff were amazingly friendly and very personable. They assisted us in all aspects of our business helping us with leads, the hotel stay and anything we needed. We were two single women in Delih so they were very helpful and assisted us in travel.In addition they have free WiFi and a conference room where we were abl eto use it all day for interviewing stayy. They never questioned the time in the conf room and were very helpful.the rooms were clean, very modern, on the small side, but perfect. Being british travellers, we are always cautious in travelling to India and yet this was a good cost hotel with great cleanliness and quality.The restaurant has a great breakfast incl, but closes early at night. Theed in a great spot right close to the Coroba market. We had also forgot one of our suitecases at the hotel and they immediately sent a driver with it to the airport - we did not have to worry about loss or theft! A hard find in India! Apr 3 2009 A Home away from Home-Will Stay Again. During my recent trip to India, I &amp; my husband stayed at Hotel Clark International at the at the beginning, middle and end of our trip at New Delhi. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel especially because of the very friendly, accomodating &amp; warm behaviour of the Hotel Staff. I had choosen this Hotel based on all the online reviews, good, bad &amp; ugly, and had decided to find out more on my own, and I can say I am very happy that I selected this Hotel. I was especially happy because of the in -room Safe, the mini bar &amp; the Complimentry Tea/Coffee, Breakfast, &amp; airport pick ups &amp; drop of. The Room &amp; the Bath were very good and modern The Hotel restaurant on the fifth floor - roof top is excellent. The food is particularly good.I was specially surprized &amp; touched to find out that on my Birthday, the cake which my husband ordered was delivered complimentry from the Hotel &amp; the food that the restaurant catered was loved, appreciated &amp; savored very much by my gathered friends &amp; family. I should also mention that -there is also a Travel service available at the Hotel Lobby, &amp; also help with Money Changers.I extend my thanks to Mr. Rajesh Patyal, &amp; Mr. Chakraverty at the front desk, Mr. Thakur, &amp; Mr. Ram Singh, Mr. Prem, and the rest of the staff for taking such good care of us. I also like to mention Mr. Haroon of the Travel Agency &amp; his associate Mr. Rafiq Khanwho have been very helpful in setting up our comfortable site seeing trip from Delhi to Puri and back. I and my Husband really enjoyed our stay in this Hotel. I and my husband are going to be the guest again at Hotel Clark International for sure and I whole heartedly recommend to anybody &amp; everybody who wants to stay at Budget Hotel with all the aminities of a Pricy Hotel surrounded by friendly Staff to come and stay here, they will not regret it. I particularly loved it ...It was my home away from home during this visit, looking forth to coming soon...Mrs. Bhattacharyyaapr1_63@hotmail.comNew York Feb 27 2009 Good location ok hotel My wife and I spent three nights im the Clark International in February 2009. The hotel failed to pick us up at the airport when we arrived at 6.15 AM, but claimed that the hotel boy had been there and that we just hadent spotted him. Might well be, but our theory is that he was there to late as we were out of the airport allready 20 minutes after the plane arrived.No problems though with a pre-paid taxi from the airport to the hotel, were we arrived arround 7:30. The reception fixed a room to us and we could sleep for a couple of hours before starting off for the city. The room was on the 3rd floor and held a lower standard than what we had expected. Later in the day - after complaining - we got another room (on the 2nd floor) which was more spacy and modern. Both rooms were clean and free of any kind of bugs.The Clark International is located in the Karol Bagh area which is quite convinient as it is close to the new and rather impressing metro. The metro will be increasingly important in Delhi. Karol Bagh also hosts a street market which is quite charming. The market starts just a block or two away from the hotel entrance.Karol Bagh is a busy area with a lot of small shops, some hotels and the streets are crammed with cars, rickshaws, cows and street vendors. Quite as it should be in a Delhi neighbourhood. The hotel was definately the most expensive we stayed in during our 16-day India tour. Delhi has a lot of very expensive 5 star hotels, and its not easy to find good options in the 3 star segment. Clark International turned out to be a good one. The only negative thing we can come up with is that there is some noise from the streets and the surroundings. (This by the way occurs to all the hotels we stayed in in India). When we were there demolition works were going on in a building near by and that created a lot of noise starting quite early in the morning. Feb 17 2009 Put us into a I booked the Hotel Clark International directly via their website.. The hotel requested my credit card information for a confirmed reservation. When we arrived in Delhi from the airport at 1:30 am we were told the hotel did not have a room for us, the hotel was fully booked. They never mentioned this to us when we called from the airport for our transfer.They said they would put us up into a &quot;sister &quot;hotel down the road. The Hotel Surya was awful... We were so tired from the flight and it was in the middle of the night we just slept in the room in our sleep sacks.Thankfully I had the insight to buy them. The next morning as we were flying to Varanasi my wrist started itching and I noticed I had small red marks, bed bug bites. I booked the Hotel Clark International so our first night of our 21 day trip to India would have a smooth start. it was anything but that..I was charged the same quoted rate even though we stayed in an inferior hotel, something I would never had booked. I could not recommend them due to this poor customer service. I felt I had been ripped off with their bait and switch.. Jan 25 2009 Satisfactory Hotel if a little over priced We spent 5 nights in total over 2 different periods at the hotel. We stayed in an Executive room though we were upgraded free of charge to a Premium room for one night.We paid £86 per night for the Executive room. This includes airport pick up, breakfast and complimentary wi-fi. I think this is slightly expensive though hotels in Delhi do appear to be expensive.The room was of reasonable size and very clean. It had a TV, a mini-bar (the contents of which were expensive) and tea and coffee making facilities.The bathroom was clean. My only criticism of it would be that in the Premium Room the shower wasn\\'t in a separate cubicle which meant the bathroom floor got very wet everytime we had a shower.Breakfast was buffet style. It included cooked food of different types each day, cereal, toast, juice and tea and coffee. We also tried the restaurant one night and one afternoon. There was a good selection of food on the menu and it was very reasonably priced. Indeed the food itself was very nice. Mind you the waiter isn\\'t very friendly unlike the other staff in the hotel!!The Hotel is situated in the Karol Bagh area and indeed is less than a 10 minute walk to the Karol Bagh metro station which is convenient for getting around the city. When walking to the metro station you pass through a very colourful market which is present on certain days.Unfortunately there was a lot of street noise at night whether it be vehicles or dogs barking. The noise was particularly noticeable in the executive room which was on the first floor (the premium room was on the 4th floor and was a bit quieter). However I would imagine street noise would be a problem in many hotels in the city.The area around the hotel is slightly rough. One thing which I didn\\'t like was the hassle we got from touts the minute we stepped out of the hotel. However this was a problem no matter where we went in the city as was begging.The hotel appear to work with a nieghbouring travel / tour company. The staff from this company appear to sit in the reception area and wait for guests. On my first morning in the hotel the minute I got out of the lift I was approached by such a person who gave me the whole selling routine. This person was very persistent to the extent he was travelling up and down in the lift clearly looking for us. In saying that we did book a guide for Agra through the company as well as a pick up and drop off to the train station. The guide was very good indeed and we were glad we did go ahead with the booking.Overall we were pleased with the hotel. It is lovely inside though slightly expensive. Jan 23 2009 One star status budget Accomodation It was their third offer of a room before we decided it would get no better. First room had creatures crawling around the shower floor. Second room offered had blood on the towel.The so called romantic roof terrace restaurant did not serve wine(we had to locate/bring our own) and the roof of same is lined with bamboo, above which numerous pigeons reside, dropping feathers etc into one food while dining. Only one of our party(of three) was sick over a five day period, but we spoke to another resident whose friend was confined to their room for a couple of days with food related problems.Tried to charge for a non appearance as one of our party coming from Thailand to meet us in India had to alter booking(due to Bangkoks a/port being closed) only refunded us after several days of verbal discussions/culminating in our having to remind manager of our post holiday review intentions.Most definately would strongly advise against booking this establishment. Jan 23 2009 Tiny overpriced Our room was very small with a heater and A/C unit that looked like they were made 50 years ago. The TV was also dated.The staff were not friendly but capable enough. They organised a free pick up from the airport, but this was a dusty 15 year old tiny car. Luggage would not fit in the boot and had to go on the front seat. They organised a lift to the domestic airport for the 450 Rupees in a slightly better small car (but not much). The plus points are a nice restaurant up on the roof, with a very nice breakfast. Jan 21 2009 Not that bad at all but greatly overpriced For CAD215 (USD 180) a night, greatly overpriced, like all hotels in India. The good: conveniently located in the quiet street of Karol Bagh, 5 minutes walk from metro. Nice rooftop restaurant. The bad: heater in the room didn\\'t work properly. Electricity outlets were so outdated that small plugs (cell or photo charger) required support to stay plugged. Hot water was in fact just warm, so shower in the morning was challenging. Jan 9 2009 Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel on the 19th Dec for 2 nights and we had booked 2 rooms. We got complimentary airport pick up which was great. Upon arrival at the hotel we were advised we had got an upgrade on both the rooms which was nice to hear.The location is great for all the tourist sights. 1 thing i would say is dont book taxis from the hotel reception as it is a little bit more expensive than a normal taxi.Considering this hotel is a 3 star budget hotel i would say it was very good. I stayed at a 4 star in Mumbai and it was awful!Good value for money and if i was to go back to Delhi i would stay here again. Nov 21 2008 Very Nice Hotel This hotel is really nice, situated in one the best areas in Delhi, which is Karol Bagh. You just come out of hotel, then right and when you hit the main market street, turn right again and at the end of that street you have metro station Karol Bagh which it will take you to the main attractions or close enough to spend a fair amount on a auto rickshaw from there.Hotel staff is very helpful, and polite. We never used the pick up service from the airport because we always reached this hotel from the train stations. We raised this concern with hotel receptionist and he provided us with a courtesy drop off service to the airport instead. The food from the roof top restaurant is pretty decent and poison free. We never had meat as in the rest of India but saw lots of people eating meat and nobody complained or looked sick the days afterwards. This hotel is on the same area of others which look more economic like the Royal Holidays and the Hotel Classic but compare to these other doggy places this is far above in all aspects. You spend more but you receive quality in all senses, while on these other places, we stayed our first night in the Royal Holidays, we never could sleep as there works in progress in front of the Hotel and since we arrived they were trying to push us to make deals to visit using their touts what you can visit on your own. They just think that people are stupid and have not read enough before going to India.Here is all the opposite, taxi prices if you request one are reasonable, help is as much as they can, advices, internet free compare to others that try to charge you with 100 rupees for a crap connection, there shops in the vicinity and there is the great market on the street heading to the metro station.Definitely If I get back to Delhi one of these days I will stay here again and can recommend it to any one. Nov 16 2008 Decent enough hotel for a short stay Hotel is a bit dated, and shows it in places. The hotel room we had was ok\\'ish. Mostly clean. The one big negative point was the aircon unit just above our heads over the bed and I mean literally just above, see picture. It was excessively noisy during the night and at one point spewed out a whole lot of built-up black grime from the street.The rooftop terrace would be nice if it weren\\'t for the heavy smog of Delhi. Otherwise the food and drinks are decent and reasonably priced.Stayed there for a night, just before flying back out of India, so didn\\'t get a chance to explore the area. It did look quite lively with street stalls at night. Nov 13 2008 \"we love being care\" It was really a good experience with my partener to stay in this hotel, the pick up was free and efficient as we arrive delhi mid night The hotel was good and clean, Hope fully i get what i payAs i fall ill was taken care of the staff with medicene food and service etc which touced my heart, may god bless them all, will recommend this hotel to everyone. Nov 12 2008 good hotel in crazy delhi excellent quality accommodation for the value in delhi.... karol bagh is a hustling area, but nice to have a quiet hotel... very friendly and helpful staff!! Nov 12 2008 worst hotel ever stayed in I would like to explain firstly that indian hotels are not of the quality you find elsewhere. That is a common theme i found throughout my stay in india and all travelers must bear this in mind before they travel there. However I was very shocked as to the state of the room especially baring in mind the positive reviews on trip advisor.The room was of a relatively nice size. However the room I stayed in would have gotten a 1 star anywhere else. There were very big cracks in the walls, the room was dirty. The airconditioning unit was very grimy, the bathroom was very shabby, the bath was cracked. All in all i am sure I could have found a hotel for the price I payed in am much nicer room. But i loved being in delhi such an incredible stay and it barely dampened our stay. Oct 21 2008 Haven in New Delhi My husband and I stayed at the Clark Hotel in New Delhi both at the beginning and end of our trip to India. Overall our stay on both occasions was excellent. The hotel is well priced, conveniently located near the Metro line (Karol Bag stop), provides airport pickup and drop off, rooms are modern, clean and spacious (large comfortable beds, in- room safe for valuables, nice bathrooms), front desk staff are helpful and friendly, food in the restaurant is convenient and tasty, a travel service is available in the lobby which can arrange a driver and tours of the city. The overall atmosphere is very friendly and staff are competent and readily provide assistance. New Delhi can be a daunting experience with so much traffic, noise and confusion and so having a place to stay such as this makes the visit so much better. We found Pankaj, Rajesh and Ekta to be especially helpful and hospitable and would readily return on another visit. Staff do their best to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel for visitors to New Delhi. Oct 13 2008 Great! We regularly stay at this hotel. On a budget this hotel is great value. The rooms are clean and modern. The staff is very accomodating, in particular Rajesh and Ekta on the front desk. One of its main attractions is the location, right at the heart of the maddness. Love it. Mrs Shah UK Sep 29 2008 Hotel Clark treated us awfully My partner and I have just returned from a holiday in India where, as part of our itinerary, we had pre-booked our first two nights at the Hotel Clark International in Delhi through Expedia, for which we were charged £40.70 per night - a lot for India, but we wanted to ensure our first nights were comfortable.As part of our booking, we had requested the free airport pickup to the hotel, advertised on the website. We received our confirmation and were looking forward to our stay at the hotel.However, on arrival at Delhi International Airport, there was no one from the hotel to pick us up. As a result, after lots of trailing around the airport in the middle of the night, we managed to find a driver who was prepared to take us to the hotel in the city (at an extortionate rate).On approaching the city, I phoned the hotel to get their exact location. I was first told by the receptionist that we only had a reservation and not a booking. I informed him that we had prepaid in full and that I had a full confirmation voucher from Expedia.He then told me that, yes, we had had a booking, but they were no longer able to give us a room, and had decided to put us up in another hotel nearby instead. We were utterly dismayed given that we\\'d spent a lot of money on the first nights of our holiday to avoid this sort of hassle!Given it was so late at night, we asked for directions to the alternative hotel - Hotel Blue Sapphire. Although we were told this hotel was of the same quality as the Hotel Clark International, it turned out to be pretty awful . It certainly was not near the quality we\\'d be led to expect from the Hotel Clark International.Until now. our experiences booking through Expedia to date have been an entirely positive experience - but this was a nightmare. At best, Hotel Clark International messed up - at worst, they scammed us into taking a cheaper hotel, and didn\\'t honour a prepaid contract. Sep 26 2008 Well priced all that you need In Delhi you get what you pay for. When I\\'m here on business I pay around £200 per night compared to Hotel Clark\\'s £35 per night. It isn\\'t the most luxurious hotel in town, but it provides good facilities in a lively part of town. Well worth the money. Dinner and beer in the rooftop restaurant good and reasonably priced too. Breakfast is pretty boring though! Hotel will normally include a pickup from the airport. I saw some negative comments elsewhere about Abyss Travel. They are the hotel\\'s &quot;travel agent&quot; for car hire etc.. If you don\\'t want to use them, don\\'t. You\\'re not under any pressure to! Sep 12 2008 Excellent Hotel in Crazy Delhi. Look, its simple, unless you want to pay £200+ per night, then you will struggle to find a quality hotel in any big city in India. So reviews about this hotel saying mediocre, decieved or overpriced, ignore!! these guys did not do there homework before getting here. The Hotel is located in Karol Bagh and is right in the heart of things,clustered with back street markets and is extremely lively. Yes, the area is not the cleanest, but 75% of Delhi is like this. We based ourselves here for 5 nights, the rooms are clean and well maintained. The food in the roof top resurant is excellent and the staff really friendly.If you want to see, feel and smell Delhi and thats probably why your are visisting this city! then stay here. Aug 27 2008 Very good experience The rooms on the fourth floor are very nice. We had a so-so room on the first night , and then we heard that the rooms on the fourth floor were better and so we moved up for the following night. It was great. Spotless, crispy white sheets, a clean modern bathroom. Breakfast is good, the view outside is great. The hotel collaborates with a travel agent named Haroon, who is excellent. He made various bookings for us and we found him friendly and reliable. Jul 20 2008 Over-priced Mediocre ... Well, it would be unfair on my part to discard this property altogether but at the same time I am unable to find justifications for having it at No 14 on TripAdvisor’s popularity index. Let’s start from 0:0 to the last whistle i.e., the moment we checked out. Check-in was anything but smooth. Despite having an explicit pre-paid reservation for two adults and two kids (6, 4) front-desk was insistent to have 600 INR/night for extra bed. Breakfast was not at all impressive … yeah even taking room rates in account. Bathroom standard should have been better. TV was not working, there is only 2-3 channels tuned in … we never tried to tune in more nor did we complaint, to be fair. Room service was prompt and efficient. Wi-fi was complementary and of acceptable speed. To conclude, I would say that you don’t really get value for money at this hotel. I am not satisfied, let alone impressed. Jun 21 2008 What a shock but a good one in the end I have been to Delhi 4 times in the past two years due to my hubby working out there. This time we were on holiday, I booked the Clark International via there web site which was so easy.We arrived in Delhi late at night, the hotel car picked us up from the airport, when we arrived at the Clark I nearly called a taxi to take us to the Imperial Hotel where I had stayed previously. We appeared to have arrived in downtown Beirut but once inside the Clark International I was presently surprised. We were taken up to our room, which was lovely, the bed was very comfotable with crisp clean sheets, air con cooled the room very fast and a great hot shower.The next day we got went up to the top floor for breakfast which had everything you could want to eat with a great view. We then went for a walk and headed down to Connaught Place to do some shopping, when we arrived back to the hotel later that afternoon we realised we were positioned slap bang in the middle of the market district of downtown Delhi, it was great, it had street markets, lovely people, great places to eat and shop and a great carnival atmosphere until late into the evening. I couldn’t believe that my hubby had been to Delhi so many times and never found this area. I loved the hotel and loved the area, next time I go to Delhi I will stay at the Clark International.TIP: Take a card from reception when you travel about as we found a lot of taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was as tucked down a side street, the card has a map on the back with address and phone number. May 16 2008 excellent value this was our first time in Delhi - we wanted a not too expensive but well kept hotel - and the Clark International conformed to our expectations. Clean, smallish but well-kept room (with noisy a/c) friendly and helpful staff.The area is noisy and colorful, which we rather enjoyed. no bad surprises. recommended. Apr 9 2008 A winning combination My brother and I were returning to India after many many years to discover the origins of our parents. Our mother (Tess) was Indian and our father a British soldier. I was born in Devlali and left as a baby.It was therefore important that we had good accommodation in Mumbai and Delhi. And certainly the Clark gave us this.The staff at the hotel were very helpful; the rooms were great and the breakfast second to none. Several times we also had lunch which was very nourishing. If we needed any help with minor things that can usually go wrong on holiday the staff acted quickly and efficiently. We found that they had a winning partnership with Abyss Tours which many other car operators must envy in Old Delhi. The pick up and drop off at the airport went smoothly and we negotiated very competitive rates from their able and competent manager ,Arif, for a sightseeing tour and a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Altogether a very satisfying stay. Congratulations to both teams at the Hotel and the Abyss.Raymond RaineUniversity Senior Lecturer UK Apr 6 2008 Don\\'t ever use Abyss Travel Bed ok, bathroom passable, meals passable general staff attitude ok. The major problem this hotel has is their association with Abyss Travel...they are a joke, so see through makes you laugh. All the old tricks...obvious plants lies, lies lies. It\\'s a shame that a &quot;could be good hotel&quot; has to associate its self with, and promote, Abyss Travel. Please don\\'t take us for fools. Apr 3 2008 Great value in the heart of things! This little gem is right in the &quot;horn honking&quot; center of things. My room was small but clean and comfortable. The staff were all very kind. There was a bit of an internet snafu when I first arrived, but the manager stayed with the problem until he got it fixed and I could get online. I could walk to all sorts of shopping and the hotel has easy access to taxis, etc.There were several tour groups staying in the hotel while I was there...so book early, the secret is out about this one. Mar 12 2008 good value the hotel is in the heart of new delhi in a non-touristy area.be prepared for a different culture, but do not be afraid of the neighborhood. free breakfast buffet was great with a mix of local and american food. the bed was comfy and the room was clean. you may need to use ear plugs at night because of dogs barking and autos honking. if you do not use the free ride from the airport, you can use the free ride to the airport. the hotel price was okay; not too pricey and not too cheap. Mar 6 2008 4* quality at 3* price A really recommendable, clean, friendly hotel with all mod cons (inc wi fi) in a busy - though not exactly central - part of town. By Indian standards it\\'s very fairly priced too, so book well in advance to be sure of getting a room. Feb 22 2008 A great find and good value for your money! After reading several reviews on-line, we booked the Clark International for 2 nights. We were very pleased with this hotel and believed we got very good value for our money. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and were very happy to assist in arranging drivers, tours or train travel at competitive prices.They have a cute roof top restaurant. Good Indian, Western and Chinese food, and a &quot;business centre&quot; where you can check your internet. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and we highly recommend it to others.Any inconveniences of this hotel were very minor:1) Like many of the places that we booked on line, it said that our room included free airport pick up and we requested this through Expedia, but it did not happen. So, if you would like airport pick up, double check that a driver will actually be there to pick you up.2) Hotel is located in a busy market area. I was happy to not have to walk alone outside of the hotel at night. The street noise could definitely be heard in the hotel rooms (as is the case throughout Delhi) so bring earplugs!3) Totally my own fault, but I left my sandals in the hotel after I checked out and went back the next day to get them but was told that they had been &quot;thrown out&quot;. So triple check your room when you leave! Feb 22 2008 very good value hotel Efficient, good value hotel. Reception staff not particularly helpful or friendly but efficient. Included breakfast was good, and Nepali &quot;head&quot; waiter very friendly. Evening meal good value and good. Room was clean, quiet and secure. Had coffee/tea making facilities which is unusual. Also minibar with reasonably priced drinks, including water, which is useful if you have just arrived from the airport. Efficient pick-up from airport even though plane was delayed. Handy for Metro. Feb 1 2008 Little Gem Stayed on two occasions in Jan. One night at first then 3 nights after a 6 day train journey.We were met by friendly courteous staff, they helped us to locate an ATM on the first stay as it was a little daunting in this very bustling city. The rooms were clean,the bathrooms had bath, shower, all very clean, mini-bar &amp; air con,TV and free internet connection. There was some traffic noise but unavoidable in such a busy city and no fault of the hotel. The breakfast was very satisfying,cereals,hot foods, eggs etc. Lunch and snack &amp; dinner menus varied &amp; were very nice and the waiters very nice,helpful. We would recommend this hotel, it was quite a &quot;little gem&quot; considering the price of some hotels in New Delhi, we would stay there again should we return someday. As we didn\\'t take advantage of their free hotel pick-up on our arrival in New Delhi, they kindly gave us a free drop off to the airport for our departure. Jan 31 2008 Highly recommend the Clark International New Delhi Have just returned from a week based at the Clark International New Delhi. Our rooms were spotlessly cleaned each day, bed linen was changed daily, hot water was plentiful (though the wet room style bathroom was a little inconvenient), staff were extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. Restaurant facilities and breakfast was very good. Room service excellent. The only downside was that the location was a little rough, as a party of four women travellers, we did not feel particularly safe stepping out alone and we were glad that we had booked the services of a driver for our stay. Would highly recommend the Clark International hotel as being very good value for money. Jan 27 2008 Good moderately priced hotel We stayed at the Clark Hotel in July, 2007. My husband is Indian, but not from Delhi, and we really didn\\'t know much about hotels in the city except that there seemed to be very few moderately priced hotels. After a great deal of research on the Internet, we selected the Clark Hotel. It was very clean, with good airconditioning (except during the daily power cuts). This was important as we were there at the height of summer. The staff was very helpful, but not all spoke good English. They tried their best, and we managed. This is not a five star hotel, obviously, but it was clean and comfortable. The morning breakfast buffet was good, with toast available for picky eaters (like my children). Indian food, as well as some &quot;international&quot; dishes like chinese food, etc, was also available for all meals, and was not hideously spicy. Even the Indian food was not too spicy. They are trying to cater to American/European palates, I think. However, I think that they are bringing in the food from another location as the &quot;restaurant&quot; appears to be a room with no kitchen attached. This can cause rather long wait times for food (think 30-45 minutes after ordering). This can be a problem after a long, hot day, especially with small children. There is a neaby McDonalds. The area is really, really busy with cars, people, beggars, etc., all the usual India issues and at night there is a market which might be fun to explore if you don\\'t mind the mosquitos. We didn\\'t do this as the kids were exhausted at night. The area might be a bit of a shock if you have never been to India before. Overall, it was a good place to stay for a few nights, especially if you don\\'t want to spend spend hundreds of dollars a night for a 5 star property, but you want a clean hotel with western toilets (very important) and A/C. The pick up from the airport was included, but the drive back was not. One other note for female travelers, is try to get some Indian clothes, like a salwar kameez. Even during the hottest of days, it is very comfortable as they can be made of very light cotton. I saw several women wearing tank tops and shorts, and they are usually being followed by groups of strange men. Not pleasant. In India, if you wear shorts and sleeveless tops, you may as well be walking around in your underwear. Jan 26 2008 Great Hotel for the price Yes, we had agreat time at the Clark after staying at a couple of similar hotels which were \\'nasty\\' Don\\'t have any doubts about staying there the place is very clean and the food brilliant,staff could\\'nt be more helpful. You can arrange for a driver to take you around Delhi for a fixed price so no worries there. I recommend you pack ear plugs even at the top 5* hotels you can hear the road noise from your hotel room.We had no problems with the water, hot water all the time. Electric went out from time to time but that happened every where in Delhi.We stayed there for 2 weeks and if I can remember it went out twice to come back on in 5mins or less. The outside of the hotel was dirty and would not liked to have walked outside on my own but that is the case all over Delhi. Jan 10 2008 Do not be deceived!! Thanks to Photoshop, they\\'ve managed to delete all the electrical wires hovering over their shaded windows, their neighboring buildings and whatever else that looks nasty in their surrounding. So when you look it up online, you would think that the hotel is in a nice, quiet area. We were on the 2nd floor and we could hear the vehicles passing by, horns beeping, people\\'s voices, et al. Not very comfortable when all you need is a good night\\'s sleep. We had a portable heater in our room and it wasn\\'t working, so we phoned the reception to replace it. They did...with another non-working unit. Great. The room and bathroom is OK and the bed was clean. But we didn\\'t really get value for our money. We think the hotel is overpriced especially with the location. Jan 1 2008 OK Hotel Great Breakfast Pros: Good hotel in Delhi, offered free airport pickup. Great breakfast included in room price. Room had a modern feel. Dec 29 2007 Good mid range hotel in Delhi My friend and I stayed here in September, the only fault was they we\\'re revamping the reception which was transformed in the space of 24hrs - no mucking about! And it really didn\\'t affect us just added to the adventures of India.We were picked up as promised from the airport which I highly recommend, the room was excellent (we chose to stay in one of the suites).The travel guide in the hotel sorted us out for our private car trips around Delhi, Taj Mahal and then onto Japiur.Food here is excellent so we ate here on both evenings! Dec 15 2007 Would avoid I did not have a great stay here. Initially when I booked, they told me a taxi from the airport was part of the package. When I arrived, they charged me 500rp for this. Then when I left, they tried to charge me another 100rp because the car was airconditioned. Also when I arrived, my room smelt like a sewer, so much so that someone had to come in and spray air freshener. The next day I changed rooms, and this was OK, so try NOT to stay on the bottom floor. The restaurant is OK with nice views. The hotel travel agent is dodgy and tried to make me go to Kashmir. However the internet was free. The service was very mixed. Some people were helpful, others were downright rude, especially the man who asked me to pay extra for the taxi. I would recommend this place ONLY to budget travellers. Dec 14 2007 An amazing hotel in the middle of the chaos that is Dehli. Having booked through Hostelbookers.com and read all the reviews, my boyfriend and I were worried about the hotels condition. I called the hotel 2 days before departure to book the airport transfer, the man was waiting ready for me. We arrived at the hotel at 6am way before check in time, but they allowed us a room at 1/3 of the normal rate. The room was amazing, all European amenities, a huge double bed and a 32&quot; flat screen TV all you could ask for in a room. we booked deluxe. We were pleasantly surprised and would definitely stay there again. Please do not be put off by the surrounding area, as you are in India you need to keep an open mind. Also the food in the restaurant on the roof is amazing, we had a tandoori platter for rs350, enough for two people. If you stay at this hotel you wont be disappointed. Nov 25 2007 Best Night Manager and very fine rooms I am a teacher who went with a colleague and 6 students on a Trip to India.We spend our very first night in the Clark and this was the best introduction to India. Although the hotel seems to be in the middle of mayhem it is a quiet spot and very western in all its amenities. The rooms were large with high ceilings and the latest in equipment and bathroom convenience... we had everything down to the bathroom slippers. The Night Duty manager &quot;Chakraworty&quot;) could not have been nicer and fullfilled every wish of us spoiled Westerners. Of course we had wireless free internet which was another plus because I wanted to let the student\\'s parents know that we arrived safely.Breakfast was also super and served on the roof top. One amazing experience. Nov 24 2007 Great Market area in Karol Bagh Great Hotel, the staff were fantastic and helpful always. I was here with my wife, 1st time to India and we started on a tour in Delhi first. After you get over the initial shock of the driving, poverty and the streets you will grow to love this little gem of a hotel. The hotel is literally a 30 second walk from Karol Bagh market which is great fun, especially as we were there for Divali so the streets were lit and fireworks everywhere. You will get beggars in this area but you will find that throughout India which is a shame as there are so many homeless children. Change is a serious problem so try and get as much as possible as you wil get harrased. Travel agent name Arif is fantastic and i swear he works 24 hour days as he is always there. He arranged tours, transports etc and we had no problems. The Hotel Dining area is brilliant, situated on the roof and very open but with covering, food is of a high standard and service excellent. Dont believe everyone who says that Delhi is expensive compared to say Agra or Jaipur, that is only on certain items. My final comment is once you get over the shock of the streets leading to the hotel you will enjoy your stay, when the driver said we are here i nearly fell out of the car, but after my trip to Delhi, Agra, Jaipur &amp; Mumbai i enjoyed the experience of Delhi the most. Nov 19 2007 Oasis of calm We were in Delhi for the VIV India Exhibition at the Pragati Maidan, cost was a consideration when I chose the Clark International but we felt we had excellent value for money. The location is rather challenging, the noise and general grubbyness can be off putting but once you are inside the hotel everything changes. We reserved a suite, (this was still a good price compared to the 4 and 5 star hotel prices) and it was great. A large canopied bed with beautiful clean linen and a bathroom with a marble floor.The rooftop restaurant is very good, the food is excellent and although the hotel does not have a bar you can get a beer with your meal. Breakfast is decidedly Indian with not very much concession to European taste but we always found something suitable.The staff are very helpful, especially the travel agent, after the show we had set aside time to visit Rajasthan and it was organised for us very efficiently by Abysss tours.Overall I can recommend this hotel as being good value for money. Nov 15 2007 Nice clean room Pleasantly surprised about this hotel that we booked for the last night of our stay in India. Very clean and functional room (401), helpful staff. They agreed without problem to replace the free airport pickup which we didn\\'t need by an airport drop-off early morning. Nov 15 2007 A Cozy Hotel in Delhi I stayed there November 6-13. The hotel staff is very attent?ve, the decor is tasteful and the rooms are comfortable. Breakfast on the rooftop is very pleasant -- ask for Chai (that\\'s delicious Indian spiced tea), not the teabag option! The hotel is located in Asia\\'s biggest shopping area, Karol Bagh. The ultra-modern Delhi Metro station is 5 minutes from the hotel. From there, you can get to Delhi\\'s commercial and business center, Connaught Place, in just a few minutes more. Nov 10 2007 Ok hotel but not great we expected better stayed in this hotel 3 nights Oct 07. transfer from airport good as we were 90 mins late the driver waited for us..our room was dissapointing ,room 407. no view blacked out widow ( a concrete wall behind) I guess it was quiet apart form hearing the lift go up and down all night.No hot water at all during our stay. Roof top restaurant average lacked a few green plants lots of bird poo on the edges of the terrace, but delhi is delhi. food nothing special. wouldnt serve us beer but others seemed to have it.( whether they took it to the table themselves)We booked with late rooms and when we came to pay extra tax (luxury tax ) was added on the bill this was a laugh as this hotel was clean but def not luxury. not at all like the website pictures we looked at before booking, staff ok but not as friendly as other hotels we stayed in. Oct 24 2007 Bed smelt of wee no hot water. We hit the Clark International Hotel after 3 weeks in Bangalore and a couple of days in Udaipur. It was the worst hotel in our trip.My wife and I are from Australia, I was in India for work and my wife joined me after 3 weeks for a bit of an explore. We booked through Otel.com, and paid online for an Executive room, one up from the normal room type. However, when we checked in we got given the most basic crummy room, which had been painted that morning (paint still wet to touch) and found that the booking had somehow come through to Clark from Otel.com as &quot;standard double&quot;. We were there 3 days and did see other nice rooms but were told that these were not available.No hot water, we had to call the lobby each time and request. Then a man would come up to our room and put his hand under the shower for 10 minutes while the boiler or something fired up, and my wife stood around in a towel. Ah, the romance of India. The bed smelt of urine, and we did eventually get it replaced on day 1 which was good. Lots of renovation going on, but they did give us some free meals at the hotel restaurant which was some compensation. To go shopping we booked a van and driver at an exhorbitant price from the hotel travel desk. The driver got sulky when we wouldn\\'t get out at the &quot;commission&quot; place that he recommended, and dropped us in the middle of nowhere, which was quite scary. Avoid...try somewhere else... Oct 15 2007 Not bad for Delhi Hotel was ok, was being decorated so constant smell of turps. No window which I found a bit weird. Breakfast was good on top floor restaurant, staff generally helpful. Oct 2 2007 Bad Don\\'t Stay Here !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Booked via Expedia 3 weeks prior to stay. Included in room price ($100 AUD) was airport pick-up. On arrival day had to email hotel to make sure they were going to pick us up (they were not bothered). We pulled up to hotel and parked - an auto (tuk tuk) accidently scratched the drivers old rusty car, the driver got out and smashed the auto guy across the head...meanwhile we were stuck in the car. Nice welcome!Check in, typical India...cold, fill out forms etc. Taken to room way way down back of hotel near generator. Room tiny, and in disrepair but neat (on surface). We thought O.K...it is Delhi (overpriced and poor quality).Within the hour...&quot;bang, bang&quot;, the sounds of drilling/sawing and metal banging. After 2 hours we called reception and asked when will the sound stop...&quot;oh 5 minutes&quot;. So after about 40 mins we thought lets go and see reception desk. Upon leaving our room the door was open adjacent. We walked into room where 2 guys were painting, the room was luxurious compared to ours and large. So we thought as we booked a superior delux we can change room. We walk up a level to see what the banging was and found all floors under maintanence, people everywhere painting, just crap everywhere.So we went down stairs and asked to see another room. &quot;No rooms&quot; we were told. We asked to see the manager...&quot;You wait&quot;. So we sat in foyer....after 30 mins of waiting we went up to the room, expecting the manager to call us when he was able. No call. About 45 mins later we decided to pack backpack and go into central Delhi for better hotel even though the Expedia / hotel took our money upon booking and credit card had already beeen charged.At reception the manager appeared. He was not bothered by our request nor concerned that we left. We did mention we would be complaining. We think they preferred not having guests at this time, cause we did not see 1 single guest during our 4 hours here.We complained to Expedia the next day, and they contacted the hotel and a refund was in the process (1 week). We would recommend not to stay here. No restaurant, no alcohol in mini-bar.We travelled for 6 weeks in India/Pakistan and by far this hotel was the worst we encountered. Oct 1 2007 Decent Value We opted for the most expensive room on the property, which was around US$125 per night. We were favorably impressed, the room was clean and very comfortable and the bed very nice. The hotel is located in a noisy and busy area, and to be honest when we arrived at the hotel we were not terribly impressed with the exterior of the building. However, the staff were very friendly and the other hotel guests we chatted with in the lobby loved the place, so we gave it a shot. The food is rather good and the rooftop restaurant is charming. Overall good value for the money but probably won\\'t stay there again simply because the neighborhood is incredibly busy and very congested. If that doesn\\'t bother you, try it out. Otherwise a good hotel. Aug 23 2007 a no go. I booked on expedia.com, choosing by price ($110), thinking there are a slew of hotels in the $30 range and a slew in the $300 range, and this would fit right in the middle. It did not. It is not near a 4 Star hotel, but what in India would be called a 3 star. Rooms are noisy, &quot;India Clean&quot; (sort of scruffy) and not worth more than $40. It seems the hotel is advertising on places like Expedia looking for people shopping by price -and trusting that you get what you pay for. While this is true generally, in India it is generally less true. Also, they overbooked us and moved us on the 2nd day of our stay: to a &quot;3 Star&quot; that was less than half the price (although they attempted to keep the rate the same) but was actually nicer. Aug 17 2007 Comfort in Unknown Territory Being a woman, alone and an inexperienced traveler, you bet I was nervous when I arrived in Delhi at 3:00 a.m. My flight was 4 hours late and I had no idea what to expect. A huge wave of relief washed over me when I found my name being held up by a friendly face at the front of the overwhelming crowd. The hotel was definitely dedicated to taking care of their guests.I was further comforted to be met with a strong display of professionalism at the reception, especially at 3:30 a.m. The other hotel staff were patient with my conflicting sleep schedule and did their best to help me obtain whatever I needed during those first hours.The hotel’s choice of tour agency to help me plan the rest of my journey to Rajasthan, Kashmir and Daramshala was outstanding. The employees of Abyss Tours were friendly and personable. I completely forgot the fact that I was alone in a strange land very far away from home. All recommendations of hotels throughout the tour were superb.I will always recommend all my family and friends who wish to travel to India in the future to stay at Clark’s and use Abyss Tours to ensure that they will find the whole Indian experience as delightful as I did. Aug 14 2007 Enjoyed our stay at Clark International! We stayed at this hotel for two days and here\\'s why I liked it.1. The staff is very courteous and helpful.2. The rooms are clean and when you request extra towels or sheets, they are provided promptly.3. The food is very good and their breakfast buffet is impressive.4. the hotel is centrally located and one can easily access major tourist attractions. Aug 5 2007 Good Midrange Hotel After having considerable difficulty locating a midrange ($50-$100) hotel in Delhi for a personal visit, we settled on the Clark Intl. based on reviews on TripAdvisor. We had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff. 1) They showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup. They come in an Indica (small car) so if you are a large family with luggage cal them and let them know in advance.2) Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean. Folks who have written negative reviews are likely having inflated expectations of what $50-60 per night can get you in Delhi. The area around the hotel is not great (in the middle of Karol Bagh) - that did not bother me so I liked the hotel esp. the courteous staff.3) The complimentary breakfast and the attendants serving it are very professional.4) We had made our own taxi arrangements for Delhi and Agra sightseeing and there was no pressure put on us by hotel staff to use their services. They did organize airport dropoff for us when requested.Overall very happy with the hotel - would definitely stay there again if going thru\\' Delhi on personal visit. Aug 1 2007 Not a bad deal for the location and facilities The hotel is centrally located in the Karol bagh area and close to Metro station . The facilities are clean and maintained reasonaby well .The complementary breakfast is good . The negatives - the surrounding areas are not too good , but you cannot have a central location like Karol bagh and peace together. They provided complimentary pick up from airport (because it was free the driver did not run AC and we did not particularly insist although it was hot) . The reception staff was also helpful in arranging early morning taxi drop off to Nizammudin Rly station.Overall a good value for money proposition and above average clean facilities in a central location. Jul 3 2007 Better than expected For our arrival in Delhi my partner and I were looking for a clean but basic hotel at which to spend our first night. After reading reviews for other hotel in the sprawling city we decided upon the Clark International.As promised the hotel duly provided the complimentary pick up from IGA as promised. Although we were informed by email before we arrived that as we were to arrive at 0800 we would not be able to check-in until 1200, this was not the case. The hotel was able to accommodate us immediately, which after a long journey was greatly appreciated.The room was basic but spotlessly clean with a working air cooler (rather that air conditioning) which was noisy but apply drowned out the street noise below.As anticipated we were offered trips, booked through the hotels\\' travel agency, but when we declined their offer there was no \\'hard sell\\', unlike a lot of India.The hotel is not centrally located but is a short five minute walk from the efficient New Delhi Metro. Jun 17 2007 Great buy off season I picked the Clark based on reviews on Trip Advisor. Got a good deal through hotels.com and then hoped that I had made the right choice. It was. My pal and I had a terrific room in a not-so-full hotel, for an off-season price that made my friends\\' jaws drop (people always tell me Delhi doesn\\'t have mid-range hotels -- apparently, we found the only one). Our two-bed room was very clean, we had air conditioning, a fridge, ceiling fan, cable TV, nice bathroom, and a very nice staff happy to help. It was as quiet as can be expected (for *Delhi*). The staff recommended a travel company nearby to rent a car &amp; driver for a day, and the driver took us to a fantastic shop for clothes, then to a beauty parlor near the hotel to get a very reasonably-priced manicure and pedicure. The second day, when we told the staff where we wanted to go, they recommended we take the metro, which isn\\'t too far away by walking, and is a terrific way to get around. There is some shopping not too far away from the hotel -- shoe stores are good, but the clothing stores weren\\'t so great. There aren\\'t really restaurants around, so you will have to rent a car/driver for that (room service is decent at the hotel). I found the hotel a great respite at the end of each day. Will definitely stay again. May 26 2007 Comparatively Impressive In general, Delhi is a shaddy place, full of touts and scammers. The Clark is relatively safe, clean, and a good deal for a budget hotel. Our room did not have any windows, but the sheets were incredibly soft and clean; the beds were comfortable, and the airconditioning a blessing. The hotel is also near a local night market and only five minutes from the Karol Bagh metro. Do not trust the hotel tour guide! He brought us to his office and pretended to call the train station for tickets. He lied about the seat availabilty, luring us to his expensive car rides. Rather, check with ABC (?) travels, which is on the corner of the hotel block. In all, the hotel was a decent stay, and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. May 9 2007 Beware of being bumped! We booked three rooms in advance for the Clark International - but despite having our bookings confirmed (and our credit cards charged!), on arrival we discovered that the hotel had over-booked itself and were abruptly ushered round the corner to a much lower standard hotel.Although our booking was with the Clark, we can only review it on the basis of the accomodaiton they supplied us with: the rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered most of the furniture); the bathroom consisted of a shower, an overflowing toilet and a bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies; the hotel was noisy (children running around and constant unidentified dripping in each room during the whole night); and the breakfast cutlery was not clean.When we confronted the manager of the Clark International about being moved to inferior accomodation, he claimed that it was due to a business conference, and as a result the cost of our evening meal was waived - but we still left feeling shortchanged and somewhat disappointed with the experience.The communal areas (including the restaurant) in the Clark seemed of an acceptable standard - the roof terrace is worth a look for the sight of a heaving city.However, even if we had a cast-iron guarantee of a room at the Clark, we would probably not book there again as the hotel does look rather tired. May 8 2007 excellent hotel. you get very good service delicious food for a very reasonnab Francoise Wang-Toutain. french nationality the location of the hotel is very convenient. Delhi metro station is a 5 minutes (may be 3) walk and the metro goes directly to Connaught place. The staff is very welcoming and help for finding places where you want to go. the restaurant on the fifth floor gives a view of this part of Delhi witha large and very clean terrasse The food is very clean and delicious (I mean for a foreigner like me) the room are comfortable (though I had not the most comfortable one). The cleaning is done correctly everyday. the internet is free access. Also on the road to the metro station you have a nice market selling indian clothes and also daily life things. It is opened until 9 o\\'clock in the evening. It\\'s a niceplace to spend some time. I stayed for ten days in this hotel for I was working In New Delhi. It was nice to come back every evening in a clean and friendly place. I would recommend the hotel for those who do not like the snobbish atmosphere of the great palaces of Delhi but still want good qualities rooms and services. Apr 18 2007 Acceptable two star hotel I stayed at that place twice, with quick and friendly check in. Rooms on both occations were small but rather clean with surprisingly good bed linen. Bathrooms came with working but primitive showers and toilets. Good towels provided and they even had toiletries. Neighborhood is an extremly busy and loud bazaar area with traffic that drives you crazy. Since no taxi driver knows this hotel, suggest you print our the location map from the hotels web side. Personally, I prefered to eat at McDonalds just around the corner, or a Pizza Hut 300 meters away, not really finding the hotel restaurant appealing enough. For cheap internet access and even printers, there is a place right next to the hotel. Apr 16 2007 You get what you pay for (in pounds dollars As several other visitors have noted, there are very few mid-range priced hotels in India. I am an American and have lived in Bangalore almost two years and find it\\'s low end or Taj properties, all over $150/night with not much choice in between. The Hotel Clark International itself was nice, but was on a narrow side street in an older part of town. I appreciated the pick up service from the airport, even though the plane was over an hour late. The driver tried to hustle me to a travel agency almost immediately, but we needed time to rest because my traveling companion was not feeling well from the flight. After an hour, he took me one minute\\'s walk to Indian Tribal Tours (see my review in Delhi info). The dining room is on the top-5th- floor, but the very old elevator only goes to the fourth floor, so it\\'s not handicap-friendly. Check in and out was efficient. The buffet breakfast was fine; omelettes could be cooked to order. There is both inside and outside seating. I asked for a quiet room and we were given a small room with no windows. Actually, the A/C unit was in the window. The hotel was a bit pricey for India and what we got, but I\\'m not going to complain about it. Apr 15 2007 New Delhi Great hotel - very basic but great service. The hotel was a bit noisy between 7am- 7pm because of the market, but you felt like you were in India and not a sterile 5* hotel.My two children loved it and we had a great short stay in Delhi. Apr 15 2007 Good service. Nice Place. Great Value. Clark International is a fine hotel. Our rooms were clean. The room service was quick and food very good. All of the staff were very pleasant.We took advantage of the pickup from airport as well as a trip to Agra and a tour of Delhi. The tours were good and the pickup is handy. The hotel took care of all our transportation and tour arrangements from the moment we landed to our departure. This is an extra cost, on top of the room, but well worth it. It made things very easy and enjoyable for us. We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Delhi for a few days. There is a bit of street noise at night, as the other reviewers have said, but it is tolerable. Apr 15 2007 Safe Clean and Trying hard Clark International DelhiTrying to maintain a decent standard of budget hotel in a chaotic city. This is clean, safe (at least for us), with services, fittings and staff that work, if all look rather tired, and decent if not exciting food. Use a locker for your valuables. There is no free mineral water, but its only about 15r from the minibar, and there are supermarkets through narrow doors and sometimes in the basements in the major shopping street, one short block from the hotel (where sundries will cost next to nothing).If you arrive on the early UK flight your room isn\\'t likely to be ready until the guests check out and it\\'s serviced, so you\\'ll need to hang around in the restaurant, with an accumulating number of guests until it is. Pay for breakfast ~300r whilst you wait, other breakfasts and transfers are normally included, all explained on their website which seems accurate in text, though the pictures are overly flattering, and taken with an estate agents eye! We could not discern any advantage of our \\'presidential-suite\\', apart from being marginally higher up from the traffic, so I\\'d suggest booking based on ensuite/no-ensuite and being done with it.Be prepared for standard scary Indian driving practises on the pickup, but the management will come to both the airport and the train station with a board whilst the driver waits (including meeting you from your carriage in the later case) which is very helpful if you take the all air-con out-early-late-back express (thoroughly recommended) to Agra for the day. There will probably be a couple of mini power outages or fluctuations during a day as well, which will trip the TV and air-conditioning, but normally last &lt;30s.The hotel is located in the odd shopping district of Delhi with small streets and shops, be prepared for noise, dust, disorganised telephone lines, stray dogs and dilapidated store fronts. It can be a bit of a shock if this is your first stop in India, the rest of the city is much the same, but there is a huge jump up in cost to the better hotels which have gardens and gates to sheild you from this.There are two metro station within a short walk, Karol Bagh is the one to head for, the other requires negotiating a difficult junction. The hotel has a useful if slightly haphazardly scaled and street named map. Its well worth collecting this along with a business card in order to get back to the hotel via an Auto through the myriad streets. We couldn\\'t find a prepaid auto stop nearby the hotel, but there are plenty in the city centre to help you get back.The restaurant is on a roof terrace which gives a good view of the urban roof top landscape, for better and for worse - geckos on the whitewash, palm squirrels scampering on parapets, kites circling in the smog, continual honking of horns, inexplicable sirens, horns or drums (depending on the date) and endless dust. It\\'s done out in Bamboo, with nightlights and waiter service and tries it\\'s best. The Indian style food is better than the western, the breakfast is an odd mix of the two. Apr 14 2007 Clark International -Good Hotel in Budget Price Peter Goh: Hi There, this is my first exprience in Hotel Clark International, New Delhi, India. And it was extremely good. They provided good service beyond my thoughts. The hotel clark is three star amenities but they have some five star facilities. I got pick-up on time as they promised. Food was really good,bit spicy but i like. Staff was very friendly. And one of the best interesting thing is free wi-fi. Room was neat &amp; clean &amp; specially beds &amp; linen. Finally we enjoyed lot. My suggestion for travellers: Avoid any type of reviews &amp; use your exprience &amp; mind.Peter Goh Apr 10 2007 Clean safe and well staffed. Pity about the noise... Although I\\'d concur with other reviewers comments regarding this being a clean, well maintained and well-staffed hotel, I can\\'t really go any further without mentioning the street noise, which a light sleeper would really struggle with. Hard to blame the hotel for this but worth pointing out.The pick-up service was good and appreciated given our delayed arrival at Delhi Airport but I found the hard-sell tactics from our pick-up regarding procuring guides and further travel tickets a little tiresome when you\\'ve just arrived off a long flight. The hotel staff were however, efficient at arranging taxis and giving advice on other transport/tourist issues.Also worth pointing out for the uninitiated, that Karol Bagh (the area in which the hotel is located) is a long way from the tourist sights of Old and New Delhi, although the hotel is just a five minute walk from Delhi\\'s crowded but otherwise excellent new Metro system (Karol Bagh stop). So the airport pick-up makes even more sense in that you can get a grip on the geography of the place before you venture out.All in all, just about worth the money but be careful if you are a light sleeper! Apr 10 2007 The Objective Truth First of all in order to provide readers with unbiased review, it will be best to start with the general context. First-timers in India, especially travellers from Europe and the US should know that India is very different place from home, not saying good, bad, beautiful, or ugly, the word different incorporates all those adjectives. My word for India would be spicy. When I arrived at the airport, I felt a little disturbed, it cannot be compared to the Munich airport that I left. The facilities looked much older, it was dirty and the place was crowded with colorful people. OK, I needed a coffee urgently, first surpise was that there was no schwarz coffee available, don\\'t you even think of a good espresso, so I had to go for a nescafe. On the way out of the customs, a driver holding a sign with my name was waiting (I requested from the hotel my complimentary pick-up). The trip to the hotel was an adventure itself, people cooking in cauldrons on the street, small cars and motorbikes everywhere. The traffic is very busy, all cars scratched and those people horn vigorously, in fact, due to the fact I guess that they drive on the right side, on the buses you see the signs &quot;Keep distance&quot; and &quot;Please horn&quot;. This habit of pressing the horn vigorously, I did not like, because in the Clark hotel, I could easily hear those, because of the ill-fitted windows. Well, the first night it bothered me a lot, from the second night on, I got used to it. A few words for the hotel - it is situated near Khan Road (Ghaffar market) and honestly it is very busy area, dirt, small shops, street vendors, ugly buildings. The hotel itself is OK, reasonably clean and the staff was friendly, but I would expect more for 60-70 EUR a night. There was hot water during the first day, then disappeared, then came back. Breakfast was...OK.... I had an omlett, some toasts and butter....the rest I did not eat. I had troubles finding good quality food. My Indian hosts, however, brought me to a distant beutiful residential area, to a restaurant called Chopsticks - excellent place (I remember it was located in Asiad Village)The hotel has a computer room with ppl who reply to e-mails, 3-4 of those young ppl I saw. Here I must mentioned that before picking up Clark international, I had hard times finding a hotel in India, and my travel agent could not help me much. Later speaking with my Indian hosts, one of my suspicion was confirmed - mid-range hotel in India is not what the European traveller expects. OK, Clark Internation is really a mid-range hotel for India, some of the other hotels in the area, those with fallen letters from their signs, really scared me. So, in New Delhi there are some very shitty hotels, some that are OK, like Clark International, and good hotels, which I later saw. The good hotels are located around Counnaught place.......beatiful gardens and luxury, but available for a bit above $ 300 a night. Some names of those are: 1. Hotel Imperial2. Hotel Le Meridian3.The Park4. Shangri La5. Ashoka Palace5. Taj MansinghIt is your choice, some people like to walk in the dirt, in those charming markets and bargain, however I got sick from the food and water (no ice, only bottled water), I had a three-day diarreah when I came back home, but this is because I was not cautious enough. I saw beautiful palces (Humayun Tomb, Qutub Mnar, Sagrafang Tomb, Museum of Handicrafts, India Gate.....), lovely gardens and everything is cheap. Apr 7 2007 Top class Infrastructure - excellent.Room &amp; Toilet - Spic n span, clean at the corners, pleasant colors, clean n comfortable bed, clean linen and towels, well stocked mini fridge.Staff - Extremely friendly, cooperative and supportive.Restaurant - very good.Travel support - very good with in-house cars and drivers. Airport transfer is included.Location - centrally located. good for shopping. metro station is close by.Suggestion - Keep tissue boxes in the rooms.Downside - not suitable if you are arriving by own car, since there is no parking facility.Overall rating - very suitable for travellers who are used to international quality hotels. Jan 16 2007 Excellent Service - good value We stayed at Clark for 4 days. Bookings were arranged directly with the hotel - we were picked up (even though our plane was delayed and we were over an hour late) and presented with roses (a bit OTT but still a nice surprise!). Staff very helpful and check in/out was very smooth.Rooms were fine - probably worth going for one up from the standard so you are higher up and away from the street noise. There is also a local market one road down that starts 5-ish until late (except Mondays) - very useful for picking up nick naks and getting quick deep fried snacks from. The hotel is about 20 minutes tuk-tuk ride to Connaught Place and about 35 minutes in a taxi from the airport.They organised a car and driver to take us on an Agra tour - much cheaper than the tour operators in the area.I have a suspicion that the food is brought in from a kitchen out side the hotel - but room service was always prompt and good value for money. The rooftop restaurant lacks ambience but worth a visit so you can watch the eagles swoop for their dinner - you can also get very close up to them as they land on the roof.The hotel doesn\\'t have any alcohol listed on it\\'s menus - but can still be ordered off the bill! Sep 7 2006 nice stay The hotel was good , Rooms were clean with clean cloth covers, Over all nice stay as it was only one night Aug 30 2006 value for money I had a nice stay in the hotel with my wife , a homly &amp; clean environment with prompt service was great . value for the money.Staff was kind and helpful. We had a nice stay and sweet memories.

The room was horrible, the bathroom was filthy - i did not wash while i was there, we arrived to find cigarette butts in the toilet, sheets where dirty, We also saw several cockroaches (although this isnt exactlyt unusual in Delhi) the tipping point came when we could hear buzzing in the room which we though to be the electricity or fan, so after turning them on and off afew times we were stumped as to what it could be; went to go back to sleep picked up my pillow to reveal 2 huge cockroaches underneath it. WRANK. Nov 2 2009 Disgusting... Dirty bathroom, fan was so loud that we cant sleep, dirty bed-clothes. We paid for pick up from airport and driver didnt want to show us where the hotel is without a big tip. Sep 29 2009 hot hot hot Hotel Namaskar has just 2 pluses: first - its really cheap (480 rupees per room for four people)second - has great locationThe other way is terriblle. Was really hot, fans are not enough, our room didnt have windows, bathrooms are owful. People are ok. Next time in New DElhi we will choose sth different. Jul 25 2009 Budget stay at Namaskar The airport pickup worked perfectly for the price of quite expensive 700Rps (and the driver wanted a big tip)The rooms were budget, no hot water, accordingly not perfectly clean rooms.The biggest issue was the extremely loud A/C, it was as loud as a lawnmower.The staff was friendly and we stay for the booked 3 nights.The location is ideal, and you get what you pay (budget rooms for a budget price). Mar 11 2009 friendly staff hot water and a bed what more do you need? I stayed at the Hotel Namaskar when I first arrived in India on the 25th January. I had arranged for their airport pickup, which was waiting as promised at the airport. The journey to the hotel was hair-raising to say the least, but then it was my first experience of Indian driving!On arriving at the bazaar, the car had to park a bit away due to the road being dug up, but the driver carried my bags to the hotel for me. I had a double room, clean and reasonably comfortable for 300 rupees a night. The toilet worked and the hot water was supplied by a boiler outside the room, which also worked. The staff were very friendly, the young Nepalese boys were great, and the other counter staff could not have been more helpful. The owner is a little intimidating, but once you get used to him he is actually quite nice. They searched online for me and found me a great flight price for my return from Goa. I stayed three nights before setting off on my travels around India. I returned for one night after flying back from Goa, prior to flying home the next day. Unfortunately the booking had been missed, but they did find me a room, not quite as good as the first but adequate for one night. Overall I felt very safe here, and it was a good introduction to India, I stayed in hotels that cost far more and provided less in other places! Mar 8 2009 For Rs300 this is what you get Good location close to New Delhi train station, friendly staff, 1 hot shower available if you ask, very basic rooms, bit run down. Personally I would pay extra Rs150 for a room with private bathroom, hot showers, new, clean &amp; comfortable at Hotel Gush or Rak International (neighbours). Feb 14 2009 Hotel Namaskar - No Thanks I recently booked a room at hotel Namaskar and arrived around 7 am. By the time I arrived at the hotel, the door was locked. The rickshaw operator knocked on the door and was told that the hotel was booked. I waited around for a few minutes and then called the hotel while standing outside the door. After wasting about 5 minutes on the phone while looking at the guy I was talking to, he finally let me in the door.Even though I booked the room online and got a confirmation email, I was told that the room would not be available until noon. Around 10 am, the owner came in and let me have the room 2 hours early. He said the usual charge for early check in was 1/2 what I was quoted by the guys when I came in. Once entering the room, it did not look very clean (I took the 400 rupee room). The bathroom was fairly small and the toilet looked very dirty. The bed did not look like the sheets were clean either. Luckily, I took the advise of another traveler and brought my own sheet to cover the bed and sleep on.I stayed another night and was moved to a smaller room (300 rupees). The second room was dirtier than the first. The sheets had not been changed and the room had not been cleaned since the last guest left. Upon entry into the room, both of the sheets covering the mattress had blood stains on them. There was an empty package of lingerie on the bed. The bathroom was a lot smaller than the first one and this one did not even have hot water in it. To get hot water, you have to take a bucket down the hall and bring it back to your room.As far as the room being cheap, not really. Yes, you can get a room as cheap as 300 rupees. But, it is not clean, and there is nothing in the rooms but a bed and bathroom (no tv, nothing). Also, international flights usually arrive very late or very early in the morning. You pay for the room from noon to noon. If you get the larger room with the water heater (no ac), you will pay 400 rupees for the room until noon. Of course, you will not leave at noon, so you will have to pay another 400 rupees to stay overnight. Thats 800 rupees for pretty much 1 day in their hotel. For 800 rupees, you can find a much better place.The staff was friendly, but in a crooked sort of way. When I asked about a good restaurant in the area, I was told that they would get me the food and deliver it to my room. I gave them 102 rupees for the food. When they returned, they did not provide me with change or a receipt. When I asked about the cost, I was told &quot;It's ok&quot; and they left.They are proud of being recommended by Lonely Planet. I was shown a copy of Lonely Planet and the recommendation by the author to stay there and book tours through Namaskar. They do take a rather large commission on the booking of the tours. The cost was about 33% higher than the cost the driver normally charges. While on the road, the driver stopped at some local shops so that I could do some shopping. Of course, these were shops where he would earn commission if I bought something and the prices were grossly inflated. 2 shops I did not even ask him to stop at or even make the slightest inclination that I was interested in purchasing the type of goods sold there. He just stopped and said it was part of the tour.The hotel offers to keep your luggage for you if you go out on a trip. I would not recommend this. While leaving, I was handed someone else's bag. If I were a dishonest person, I could have walked away with somebody's luggage.I stayed at Hotel Namaskar after reading some reviews on a website that claimed it was a good deal and it was clean. If you want a clean place at a reasonable rate, look elsewhere. Mar 14 2008 Very cheap in the heart of Paharganj We booked the hotel for its price and reccomendation of guidebooks. The area of Paharganj is not the best in Delhi, so if you want anything remotely fancy don't stay here. The hotel looked like one of many in the area, which is packed, but we didn't have any hassle in our stay at all.The room is clean enough and very big, with some weird cables hanging from the wall, and a not very nice toilet with not very warm wather.They can arrange the pick-up from the airport, which saves you lots of hassle if you are not used to the india-taxi way of life.Also, they can organise tours around Delhi and Rajastan, though they take a fairly big commission and if you have the chance, you would do best booking straight from a driver.Our stay was not memorable, but it served perfectly its purpose of having a cheap place to sleep in Delhi. Jan 8 2008 Very cheap you get what you pay for Found this through Lonely Planet, one of the few places that was very responsive to my email inquiry. Their airport pick-up service was on-time and waiting for me, but I did not feel safe in the minivan they drove, which was very old, has poor shock absorbers, and no seatbelt. At one point the car hit a speedbump too fast and I flung forward, knocking the front passenger seat out of place. The reception and staff are friendly and helpful, but they are always a bit too eager to book tours for you.The hotel is located in the Paharganj, in an alley just off the main market street. This is a very active, loud, and dusty area, and there is a public urinal at the entrance of the alley. It is walking distance to the metro (Rama Krishna Ashram Marg station), and one metro stop away from Connaught Place.My room &quot;double&quot; room was very spartan, there were two twin beds pushed together and just enough space to walk around it, and a small table in the corner. Walls were pink, as warned in Lonely Planet. The windows were blacked out, but I could hear the street noise and the heavily polluted street air made its way into the room. There was also a ceiling fan and a/c. The bathroom was small, and there is no separation between the shower and the toilet (this is standard for most hotels in India). No hot showers, as there was no hot water in the room - they provide you with a large bucket and you retrieve hot water from a tap down the hall. Also, the only available electrical outlet in my room had been taped onto the wall.The room appeared clean enough, but as with most hotels in India, the room does not get serviced daily. Bathroom looked kind of disgusting with a lot of water stains and water damagede door. Toilet paper is not provided. The sheets were clean, some more threadbare than others, all had some stubborn stains or cigarette burns. I stayed for 4 nights and got very sick from the poor air quality (this is clearly evident when you blow your nose at the end of the day). Essentially, you get what you pay for. Many locals avoid the Paharganj area because it is even too chaotic for them to endure, but it does have lots of shops, tourists, internet cafes, and cheap eateries. As a tourist, you can also expect and get used to being hassled a lot. Sep 25 2006 Friends from other hotel This hotel is recommended by Lonely Planet. The problem of accomodation being recommended by Lonely Planet is that the hotel will tend to be over booked or over popular. This Hotel Namaskar is the first on top of the budget hotel list, so we called to make reservation two days before we reach Delhi. The person who takes the call said the rooms are alway available and we can come to stay any time.When we reach Delhi, we went straight to the hotel which we had made reservation and I saw my name on the reservation book too. Then the man at the counter ask his man to show the room for me. At the point of time, I realised something was wrong, the man took me to other hotel which do not even known to me. I realised later that the hotel that we want to stay is full. So in order not to loose any chance of earning a little more income, the owner without even telling us what happen took us to the other hotel nearby which probably will give him some commission if he &quot;defer&quot; a customer to his hotel. Mar 24 2006 Basic in the Bazaar Basic hotel in the Main Bazaar area. Rooms are cheap, relatively clean but very basic. The staff and especially the two brothers are extremely helpful and can arrange for tours at very reasonable prices both in Delhi and wider India. It is this that is the main attraction.Up a small alley off the main bazaar you have to pass an open urinal at the start of the alley. The location is not for the faint hearted as you are pitched into the noise and squalour of Old Dehli on your doorstep although personal safety was never an issue. Feb 26 2006 cheap clean noisy I spent 3 nights in Namaskar hotel. The people of the hotel can take you from the airport, even during the night, for 400 rupies (8 euros). They can book a taxi for you, and many other things. They can keep some of your luggage (even a computer) a few weeks until you come back. It is really near main bazar street.We spent 2 nights in a room for 2oo rupies (4 euros) for 2 people. Their was too much noise (because of the fan and the corridor), too much light during the night, some problems with the water (there was no more water during one hour maybe). The room was clean.We spent another night in a 450 rupies room (9 euros). It was really bigger, with 2 bathrooms, but as much noise and light. However, I don't know if it is possible to have better hotels for less than 600 rupies a night in Delhi, where so many hotels are &quot;expensve&quot; (for India) and of bad quality.If you want to sleep in this hotel it is better to phone them to book the nights you want before you come to Delhi. If you arrive from the airport it is better to ask them to send you a taxi to avoid a lot of problems the first day !!!!(a french tourist) Feb 15 2009 Quelle déception! Nov 20 2008 Super Service- gute Adresse Oct 3 2008 Loin d'être acceuillant Jun 3 2008 Bof bof\", doc_id='05646a72-a3c1-4b05-b173-423ecf52686f', embedding=None, doc_hash='9bc31e1aafdae58d4f86ba91c6decd3fd470a34afbc117c25a3019da3fb91430', extra_info=None)], [Document(text=\"Nov 20 2009 Fine business hotel -- not fully luxurious but well above average I was put up here by a Government of India agency I was visiting. The hotel is owned by GOI, I believe, and so they get preferential rates. It was of the caliber of a nice Marriott -- clean, spacious (I was in the &quot;annex&quot; wing), relatively modern. Not glitzy (I'd stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi 10 days earlier -- that was about as glitzy luxurious as I've ever been). Service was professional but not obsequious, not overly solicitous. If I'd paid myself, I might have been disappointed, but compared to other &quot;business&quot; hotels I stayed at in India, this was fine. (I'm from the US, have traveled extensively in developing countries.) Nov 14 2009 Old glory that has disappeared for ever I stayed at The Ashok for 4 nights at a business trip in the beginning of November 2009. What a disappointment. Old glory has gone and it will take a multimillion investment to ever get this back. The state of the hotel is miserable, the only thing that has been restored is the entrance lobby. The room was middle sized and looked rather Ok, but there is a big cleaning problem here. The floor was really dirty, no way to walk bare foot here. Free wireless internet was available and it worked well, but every 24 hours you had to return to the reception desk (very long walk!) to get a new voucher. There is a problem with staff in general and the front desk staff in particular. They are not interested at all to give any service to their guests. Their only interest seems to be to get tipped! As an example, I was informed two times wrongly about meeting places because the staff just didn’t care to look it up properly, which resulted in two times a 10 minutes’ walk to the wrong place.The Ashok is a very big hotel in the diplomatic area of Delhi, so the surroundings are nice. This is the only positive thing I can say about this hotel. Next time I definitively will look for another place to stay in Delhi. Nov 5 2009 Definetelly not a 5 star hotel I stayed in Ashok for 2 nights during a conference. The booking has been made by the organisers of the conference so I had no choice. Before visiting the hotel I read the reports n the tripadvisor and I was terrified!Upon arrival I had some positive feelings because the lobby areas is really fine and the service I received in the front desk very good. Upon entry in my room the disappointment started. The big problem with the hotel has to do with the cleanliness. The hotel and particularly the rooms are dirty. The space of the rooms is fine, the furnitures really old (but OK) but you can see everywhere that there is no proper cleaning. I tried the room service and although efficient (it took about 20 minutes) the food was of a fast food quality.Staff was friendly and the wireless internet fast enough and free. In no case this is a 5 stars hotel, but it is not terrible. Oct 5 2009 Good loaction average service I stayed in Ashok last month with my family for a brief holiday. The location is quite good almost midway between the city center and the airport. The staff was courteous but a bit lazy, rooms were good but seemed a bit old as far as the upholstery is concerned. The bathrooms do need a lot of improvement and this was one negative factor of the place. The food was average and we preferred eating outside in the private restaurants situated within the building. The pricing was definitely on the higher side as compared to the services offered.The place is undergoing some massive renovation and i expect to have a better experience the next time I am in Delhi. Jun 18 2009 Cheapest Five star in delhi..expansive but moderate service Great expansive property in one of the best areas in Delhi.Right in the heart of diplomatic enclave, this hotel has seen its better days.Still, it is trying to modernize post privaitization and addition of Fbar and the host of events it hosts is propelling it forward.Price is normally around 8k INR which makes it one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest in Delhi.Always full of foreigners (mainly backpackers or organized trippers), Indian bureaucrats and Indian airlines crew, this is a nice value for money hotel.During one stay, i got a refurbished room which was a huge improvement over the previous ones. In room dining can easily be accomplished for 400/500 per person a steal.Sagar ratna is a recommended restaurent. The pool isnt heated and the staff are servile and still retain the sycophantic outlook always on the lookout for tips.in all stay if you want a five star at the cheapest rate in the best part of delhi. Jun 15 2009 Big but not Luxury Hotel Jet Airways Provided us one night stay at this hotel.As Jet Airways staff didn't board our baggage at origination Point.So,this stay was given by Airlines.But we didn't find this hotel equal to 5 star hotel standards.Rooms were smelly,A/C was not effective,No Courtesy by staff,Breakfast was cold,Dinner was not good in taste.So,we will say this was an average hotel &amp; we will never prefer to go there. Jun 11 2009 stinky poo Worst room, service, foodand stinky Toilets.. Don't use the hotel.. Not for human beings May 29 2009 Great Business Place Great LocationBest FoodGood Pool Good Business FacilitiesGreat House KeepingHelpful staff May 3 2009 loved the disc this hotel is situated in a good location....and can say...its value for money Apr 19 2009 Subject of an Emperor As an invited participant of an' International Stakeholders' consultation,I was accommodated in 'The Ashok',Chanakyapuri,New Delhi. An aristocratic name in the diplomatic enclave of the capital city raised our expectations to perhaps somewhat unreasonable limits.There were major problems with the attitude and approach of the staff which started considering you as subjects of the royalty(a subject /Praja of Maharaja/Emperor Ashok) the moment they realized that for the 'second class guests' everything is on the house/to be paid by the organizers.Even an offer to utilize the services against a payment was looked in a dubious manner with not so polite insistence on submission of all the details of credit card etc.I am sorry but even after a passage of more than 3 years I do not remeber a moment after the seesions which I enjoyed there though it could have been very easily done.I still cherish the time spent at Hotel Japhu,Kohima,Nagaland,Taj,Chikmaglur,Hotel Oberoi,Calcutta,Holiday Inn,Genva,Hotel Kigali,Rwanda and Taj Colombo Sri Lanks etc. mainly beacuse of the welcoming and accomodating attitude of the respective staff. Apr 18 2009 Very good property no value for money The ashoka hotel is one of the grandest hotels in India built by the govrnment. The hotel has exceptional facilties - the gym and swimming pool is very good. The price is very high though for the qulity of service and good. The service is more govrnmentish with people wanting tips for even small work. The gym is one of the best in India and attracts the political class and sportsmen. The food is good and has signficant variety. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to spend a short time in New Delhi and needs access to central delhi Apr 17 2009 lousy place at a very high price This is a very lousy place with nothing great about it and comes with a very high tariff rates. Everything is very costly and rooms are not well maintained. the only exception is the its Restaurant Frontier which serves good food. Mar 22 2009 =not as horrible as expected I stayed at the Ashok this past week and was quite relieved that it was not as horrible as the other reviews indicate. My room did not seem dirty, and housekeeping came daily - i left a tip each day, so maybe that helped. Bugs: i did see a small roach in my room on night one, he was dead by morning from insecticide poisoning. Previous reviewers complained about a bad smell in the hall- it's clearly insecticide, i take it roaches are hard to eradicate in that part of the world. It was kind of gross to find the coverlet on my bed smelled of bug spray, but what can you do, better that than more roaches. It IS a third world country, after all...i think the problem is that they are charging first world prices. If my workplace hadn't paid, maybe i would have been more upset with the shortcomings. I def. wouldn't stay there if i was paying!the staff: here i will agree. they were rude and impatient when i repeated things back to them to verify information about how to get a cab, or where to store my luggage in the interval between check out time and the end of my conference. did not appreciate the attitude. i am a woman traveling alone, maybe you could be a little patient that i want to be sure i have the information right? and yes, housekeeping are big tip seekers....despite leaving a tip when i left in the morning, they would ring my doorbell at 8-9 at night to &quot;see if i needed anything&quot; I woud ignore the doorbell and then at least once they called on the phone! go away! they hang out in the hallway and pounce when you come back to inform you that they changed the fruit in your room or whatever,. looking for a tip. Also i was supposed to have free breakfast in the coffee shop included in my room tarrif. Most days i didn't bother. My last night there i got ill and tried to exchange my breakfast ticket for two cans of sprite the next morning, to soothe my stomach. they wouldn't do it. wanted me to pay. I tried to reason with them that whatever food i would eat if i came for breakfast would cost more than the sprite. i wanted two cans of sprite for breakfast, right? they had me sit down, talked amongst themselves, offered me canned juice. Juice made me sick in the first place. They wouldn't budge. This completely pissed me off. that is one star customer relations. WTF? He tried to tell me the relative expense of the items wasn't the issue blah blah blah but i lost patience to hear his explanation and stalked out. They just wanted more money. Like every freakin' Indian i encountered in Delhi, unfortunately. hang on to your purse because people will be trying to sell you things/cheat you at every turn! Mar 8 2009 over priced - under whelmed - ashock ing hotel shabby, smelly , tired, and that was just the staff. Poorly trained they did not have a clue. The fixtures and fittings were poor, the views awful and generally just disappointing. Our deluxe room had a comfortable bed and that was about it. One scruufy towel each, a grubby bathroom and no sign of any love or care.Of the six restaurants in the hotel only two were open and one of them was just vile. The other was average but top prices.Our 3 1/2 night stay cost £700 - do not stay here.This was billed as a five star hotel with matching prices - I suggest they invest in some lessons from the Taj Group - felt completely ripped off and we were both very ill into the bargain. hope it loses down - would like my money back! Mar 1 2009 Nice but over priced good location near airport Good pick up at the airport, nice room and grounds but over priced. Feb 22 2009 sad... Was my 4th stay at the hotel since 2000 and sorry to state that it's not getting better. Staying there as it's the place of the conference I am attending so it's just to avoid taking taxis on several occasions per day.... Had booked and confirmed room with balcony though received room without. When referring back to the reception's staff (be aware of the cashiers, as greedy as the years before) was informed, that the rate is the same... It's by far overpriced and one has to greet the staff, it's not the staff greeting you.... Meals at coffee-shop are &quot;OK&quot; while the staff at coffee-shop is at least trying to be friendly and fast.... trying... The staff at business-center tried to be of help and while services are really expensive, none of the 11 mails I had send arrived..... Feb 13 2009 What a view! I and my wife were travelling to Delhi for romantic getaway. We wanted to experience some really good places &amp; things together.We wanted to spend time in some good hotel so we could remember the stay as well as the places of stay. We had heard a lot about Hotel Ashok, how magnificient it is and how marvelous the view from the hotel top looks.We called up and booked a reservation for us. When we visited the hotel, we were impressed by how huge it looks from outside and how well it was maintained. The reception was quite good. The wait at the checkin was not at all there and within few minutes we were escorted to our room by a bellboy.The room was spectacular. It was well furnished and even the bathroom had marble tiled floor and huge mirrors. The room was spacious and had a very huge balcony. The Balcony was overlooking some gardens and playgrounds. THE VIEW FROM THE BALCONY WAS AWESOME. It gave us a very open view of the outside, yet private from others. We loved it.The restaurant in the basement was quite good. They have different types of restaurant serving different kinds of cuisines. We tried few of them and they were quite good food.Coming to the cons: As known before, the hotel is slightly on an expensive note. It is not easy to use it as a regular getaway. We had our own transportation for most of the time and hence distance wasn't the matter but on a few occasion, getting public transportation was not easy. However the hotel do have lot of Auto and Taxi guys waiting around and the doorman can help to get one for you.Overall, it is a great place and we really enjoyed it. Nov 6 2008 loved the ambience I heard a great deal of bad reviews before we left. The Ashok is a government owned hotel and hence does not have the massive private investment of the other in the diplomatic enclave. I was greeted in a friendly manner when I arrived (4am, can't say I'm to impressed with Delhi Airport), staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay. I am on the 3rd floor in a really nice room, I have two beds to myself, my room is cleaned and stocked daily. Everywhere I go I am saluted or bowed to, the decor is good, the place is clean. A few things to watch for: A few of the plug sockets have issues but for RS70 you can get a pretty good plug adaptor, the food in the 'Coffee Shop' is good enough, nothing special and the Paprika Chicken is awful, don't try the chinese restaurant, we ordered 3 plates of food and some rice and each dish got steadily worse, the first was what looks like a plate of ears (Chicken), the second looked like a pile of rotting cat poo (Beef) and the third looked like a collection of arteries and viens (Lamb) - absolutley disgusting! The rice wasn't bad though. Stay away from most of the food, check out the 'Fusion' bar, the staff are great and really freindly. I would definatley come here again. Oct 7 2008 don't ever think about it! OMG! I don't know what kind of star it has, definitely it's not shining!!! My husband and I went there for a medical convention.we arrived late evening, checked-in and went straight to our room. voila! smelly,bedcovers are dirty, yellow stained pillow cases,,creeking wavy faux wood flooring and bathroom was filthy! thanks heaven we brought our rubber slippers! you can't walk inside without it! haay, the next morning we went to the convention and came to the hotel room late...Surprise! room was smelled up with tobacco! i was angry but my husband told me to keep my cool. the next day, we let the cleaning man tidy up our room, my husband was in the shower and me reading seated behind a desk. peeking once in a while to see if the man is doing his cleaning job properly. satisfied, we gave him a big tip and closed the door. my husband went ahead to the convention and left me. while i was in the shower, someone rang the doorbell, thought it was my husband and might forget something, i ran to the door since it has no observation hole, asked loud &quot; sweetheart, is that you?&quot;. then that someone spoked indian that i dont understand and i said &quot;later&quot;!! with emphasis! after a shower, i put on my clothes and was taking my time putting on my make-up, somebody rang the door again. the cleaning man gave me a basket of fruits and a bottle of coke and i said thank you and closed the door. rang the door again, it was a man wearing black suit and said that my laundry will be delivered that same day, i said thanks and closed the door. after i made myself up, i headed to the door to go out but suddenly the phone rang, thought it was my husband, i picked it up and said &quot;hello? sweetheart? helloo, hello? but the other line was just listening to my voice and all of a sudden i heard this voice of a woman moaning and in indian language! lewd! i placed the receiver down in a hurry and frozed, wondering what was it? who was it? after several seconds the phone rang again, i let it rang 3 times, i answered it again with firm and loud voice &quot; dad, is that you? hello,who is this?!! hello,hello?!! same thing happened again! i banged the phone, trembling,terrified. ran out the door and asked the cleaners who was the prank caller that made the lewd calls. i dont know if they understand me! my gosh! this is supposedly a five star hotel in their country! is it?!!! or never? after i complained, i noticed that there are more securities all over the hotel! holy cow! we've been around the world and never encountered such a thing! we will never go back to that place again! before that thing happened, the staffs look at you creepily as if they haven't seen a woman before! and outside of that hotel as well! creeeepy!!! rating? BLACK STAR! Sep 29 2008 Smelly This place is awful. Our convention was held here, and so, in order to avoid the hassle of getting a trustworthy driver every day, we decided to stay here despite the negative reviews. Hotel staff were a little creepy. Our hallway smelled very bad (especially in the mornings). Luckily, most of the smell remained in the hall and did not come into our room. That's not to say that our room didn't smell, it was just better in comparison. It was impossible to get internet in your room, so you needed to go down to the main lobby to get any work done. And since only one of the electrical outlets in the lobby seemed to be working, you had to make sure your computer was well charged before coming downstairs.I did see one roach in the hallway, (luckily again, not in our room). Stains, of course, on the towels/shower curtains. Our friends from Kenya were met with unacceptable racism from the hotel's club. I can't possibly say enough bad things about this hotel. Stay somewhere else! Aug 20 2008 In my 6 weeks in India this was the worst In the 6 weeks and 15 cities I've been to in India, this was the worst of the worst (and I stayed here more than once!). The staff was the rudest I've encountered anywhere, the room was dirty, the location was far from anything, and it was of course overpriced. I highly recommend against staying here. Aug 3 2008 !!! AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHH !!! We have never stayed in such a filthy, crumbling, insect ridden, mold covered, noisy, smelly establishment in my life - and wouldn't wish anyone else to!! Had we wished to experience such a place, we would have booked into a B&amp;B in the bazaar. On second thoughts, that would probably have been a nicer place to stay!!!The windows didn't fit properly so you had the noise and the smell of the traffic. We slept on top of the covers because of the state of the bed linen and would not walk on the carpets in bare feet. As for the bathroom - we washed in the sink rather than use the shower/bath.Doors to service areas/laundry were left open and you could see and smell the mold growing on the walls. Quite nauseating - it just made our skin itch!!One night was one night too much but as we'd arrived at 10pm, we didn't have the energy to look elsewhere!For a government run hotel, it was an absolute disgrace. The place ought to be knocked down as it is a health hazard. Even if this was the only starred hotel left in New Delhi, we would not stay here again. We would take the B&amp;B in the bazaar any day of the week!! May 2 2008 Value for Money Room rates in Delhi are surely overpriced as there is such a dearth of world-class hotel accommodation. In such a scenario, the Ashoka Hotel is one of the most reasonably priced 5-star accommodation available as it is still government owned.The acommodation is good and the service even better. Though many years old, the hotel has good rooms that are well appointed and reasonably big. Will surely use this hotel again. Mar 18 2008 Stay away !! I would advise you to stay away from this hotel. I found that my hair dryer would not work, nor my television, not the desk light nor the floor light, and some of the electrical sockets. As I discovered them, most of these necessitated a visit from staff - at first I tipped those who fixed them, but then decided maybe this was a racket to get more tips. I was also suspicious about the fact that they only turned down the beds and left in fresh water AFTER I had gone to my room in the evening, no matter how late I returned - and waited around for a tip. They stopped turning down the bed after two days when i left them tipless for this. The shower curtains were stained, as was the armchair - and i found dirty slippers with lots of dust under my bed. When my message light showed, I discovered that the message key did not work, the first person I asked to help me on this never came back to me on it. Eventually i found another staff person who managed to get my messages, through an unknown code which he did not give to me - there were no instructions on how to access these messages anywhere in the room. The food (which tasted quite good, or at least the indian style food) was very expensive - more than the price for a similar meal back in the U.S. Service however was terrible - we waited 15/20 mins for some water to be brought to us. The use of wireless access cost $25 a day. The cost per night for this hotel is outrageous for a Delhi hotel - $250 a day - best go elsewhere. Mar 3 2008 Dirty buggy and ridiculously overpriced My husband and I stayed here for a conference at the end of February. It's a dump. Our room hadn't been vacuumed in ages, there was hair everywhere and orange pits on the bathroom floor, and our room (and a colleague's) had cockroaches. We're seasoned travelers and have stayed in dodgy places before, but for $250/night (the conference rate), we expected to at least be able to walk barefoot from shower to suitcase without accumulating someone else's hair and food on our feet. I don't know what the cleaning staff does there, besides barge into your room to deliver unnecessary and unrequested items (matches, extra bottles of water when you already have three) in the hope of getting a tip. In addition, the elevators shorted out on us a couple of times, and our electronic door-key receiver thing took three or four tries to unlock. The (consistently rude) hotel staff gave me the key to someone else's room and then acted like I'd done something sneaky to get it, and they lectured my husband on the proper insertion of the key card when he tried to get a replacement for his non-functional key. Conference meals were held in a courtyard area with thin carpeting laid over a mystery substrate that was apparently full of rocks. I saw many conference-goers trip and spill their food. (No great loss, as the food sucked, but dangerous all the same.)To top it all off, the lobby is full of carpet and trinket shops, so if you haven't already grown sick of hearing &quot;madam, take a glance, no need to buy, just look,&quot; then you're sure to get your fill on your way to the elevators.Try hard to stay away from the Ashok. Feb 23 2008 May be OK one day Hayes &amp; Jarvis &quot;upgraded&quot; us to the Ashok from the Oberoi Maidens for the first 3 nights of our India tour. We read the reviews and hoped it would not be as bad as reported, but unfortunately it was. Our rooms were dirty, especially the bathrooms which looked as thougth they had not been cleaned properly for years. You could hardly see in the mirror and the last guest's rubbish was still in the bins. It was very difficult to get rid of our creepy room &quot;boy&quot; who seemed to appear for no apparent reason every time we went to our rooms. My mother, particularly, was rather unnerved as she was sleeping alone and dreaded him just walking in - in the end she had to be quite rude to him, which is not her nature at all, and after that we hardly saw him, which was quite a relief. The restaurant was OK but a long walk along a miserable corridor from the main part of the hotel. We were not keen on the buffet dinner but the a la carte meals we had were acceptable and not bad value for money. The good news is that they do seem to be in the process of refurbishing the hotel and the new parts, like the &quot;Island&quot; restaurant and the business centre are very nice. I think it will one day be restored to its former glory but they also need to train the staff to do something other than look for tips. Feb 18 2008 A Shoker! Delhi is suffering from an accute hotel room shortage. The result is the Ashok at USD400 a night for an ordinary hotel room, ordinary tired property with ordinary to below average service. The room is clean, the bed comfortable and the water hot but for USD400 you want a little bang for your buck.The fridge was faulty. TV reception unwatchable despite three visits by repairman. Mod cons like the &quot;wireless&quot; internet served up a strength that redlined at least once a minute making transfers of longer documents virtually impossible (again technicians could not help). Request for ice through room service (no machine or alternative available on the executive floor) was accompanied by high expectations for a tip and on one occassion unannounced entry when I left the door ajar accidently (ie did not knock before entering).Seriously, there are some great hotels in Delhi (I like The Park) - The Ashok is not one of them Nov 20 2007 Stay clear of the Ashok Overrpiced - London prices for poor quality rooms and miserable service. The lowest point was when the waiter in the lobby lounge wiped the tea cups with his finger, and later washed our cups behind the desk with water from a mineral water bottle, from which he was also drinking. The same waiter also had poured us two cups of tea, then whisked the teapot away to finish the rest of the tea with his colleague. Do not stay there! Nov 15 2007 They issued the room to another guest 1 hr after I checked in! I was shocked that someone opened my door after midnight and we found out that the hotel issued the same room to another guest! I think that was an inexcusable error, what kind of security is that?I booked for a Superior Room but was given a Standard Room instead. The room is qutie recently renovated. The bathroom has no bathtub so the floor is wet after shower. There is not enough space to place toiletries too. The sound proofing is not good. I could hear TV noises from other rooms and the staff can be loud when they go around their duties along the corridor.The breakfast buffet was ok, your best bet is Indian food. The masala dosa was good. But no dosa on Sunday.The best part of the hotel is its gym. Modern equipment with individual TV screen. The staff seemed to be more friendly towards the regular clum members though. Aug 24 2007 The good and the bad OK, good things first: The hotel has a an awesome architecture and presents the atmosphere of the historical New Delhi. The reception hall and the sheer size of the hotel is impressive.The service is friendly and the restaurants are of good quality. The fitness and SPA area is really first class: Latest equipment and qualified trainers.For the rooms the experience is different: I stayed in the 6th floor, my room was obviously renovated and had parquet floor and relatively new furniture. The cleanliness and hygiene however was beyond any acceptable standard and would not be accepted even in a roadside motel: The bed was dirty and old curly hair from previous guests still present on the linen ....eerrgg ! The toilet was bearing week old traces of dried detergent fluid and the seat was spotted with different brownish colors. The shower handle just fell from its bearing upon touching and clear water only came after several liters of rusty brown water went down the drain. Obviously no room checks were made before renting it out to the next guest. On the following day the bed clothes were replaced,so no hair anymore, but then the linen had black greasy spots on it with doubtful origins. So I used towels as bedsheets. To sum up: for a five star hotel unacceptable and overpriced. Hygiene and cleanliness were kill factors, I do not accept this at 1 or 2 star hotels, not to speak of a five star ! As I said in the beginning the hotel has a good potential and facilities are worth five stars. If the management can cope with the housekeeping issues it will certainly get better ratings. For me however, it was the last time that I stayed there. For this room rates you get other five star hotels in Delhi. Aug 20 2007 Lovely Hotel I'm glad I didn't read these reviews beforehand. My husband and I stayed at the Ashok Hotel last weekend and we had a lovely time. We did not have reservations and when we inquired about rooms, the receptionist upgraded us to the executive floor at regular rates. The room was clean with a view of the pool. The bed was soft and comfortable, the room included many amenities and there was plasma tv. All the staff were accomadating and friendly. The food and drink at the restaurants were great and the pool and spa were beautiful. The executive lounge was nice and convenient (breakfast was served just down the hall from us on the 6th floor). We are from Canada and I was not expecting to stay at such a nice place. It is an old hotel, but that adds to the charm. It was beyond my expectations. The only reason I did not rate it above average was because of the price. It was expensive, but a weekend in Delhi to see the Taj Mahal was worth it. Aug 2 2007 Krishna the porter We had a terrible shock at the Ashoka Hotel! When we actually arrived in our room we found that there was a complimentary fruit basket which was mouldy and as old as or maybe older than the hotel....There were fake bottles of water...that were supposed to be mineral water but had been filled up with local tap water, we figured this out from our stomachs that night and this was very unpleasent. As for the plumbing, the toilets were over flooding and lets just say what went down came straight back up! ....Now for the service...the porters were constantly knocking at the door...waiting for tips and asking silly questions.....me and my sister thought we had accidently checked into fawlty towers (then again if we had we would have been some what lucky to an extent). One night the porter followed us in our room, we thought it was a service to be dropped to the room but when he came inside withouth an invite we were shocked! He told us he didnt drink alcohol and yet he managed to swig down half a bottle of bacardi! He kept inviting us to go and eat with him and his family, more fool us, we didnt actually realise we were invited to foot the bill and tip the resteraunt! The cheeek of it! They also refused to take credit card payments and would only accept cash! The only thing they would keep saying to us is &quot;ma'am! As polite as they were sounding it was very difficult to communicate!!....We could go on forever with the stories of how we survived for 7 nights but save urselfs from the misery! Also being Indian me and my sister felt discriminated against as there were rules for people!...Our final trip was to the Taj Mahal...we went for a day trip and as there were a few more spaces in our private transport the hotel staff invited themselves to come....and they robbed money and cheated my elderly father! Be warned of these people and their hotel! Jun 12 2007 Okay in our section but not 5 stars We stayed at the Hotel Ashok, 50B Chanakyapuri, as part of a group tour making a brief stop in Delhi. It is a huge hotel with a number of restaurants and a shopping arcade and a fancy business center. It is in New Delhi south of the government area, with no neighborhoodto walk to, and no nearby subway. Would not have been particularly convenient if we had time for our own outings, but we did not. Our room in what must be the renovated wing (far to the right as you facethe front of the hotel) was fine, but rooms in the other wing did not sound that great. We did not find it to be nearly as bad as the pans on Tripadvisor.com, and we found the service to be fine, but it definitely does not deserve its apparent 5 stars or justify the price(apparently $200+). Mar 10 2007 Trust these reviews - honest! As a government owned hotel the service is about as bad as it gets. Hotel restaurants are pretty poor as well - I had to send back under cooked chicken, and the fish got its revenge during the night :-(Was probably a great hotel 30 years ago but now rooms are shabby and run down. Do yourself a favour and stay away. Feb 24 2007 Very very disappointing Do youself a favor and trust all the negative comments about this hotel. It's definitely not value for money nor what is expected of it's &quot;star&quot; rating. I stayed two nights at the hotel and the first night was terrible. The room was muggy, sheets were dirty and the bed was not even flat! The telephone looked like it hadn't been wiped down in 25 years, seriously no joke. I demanded a room switch (which reception took forever to concede to) so the second night I stayed in the newly renovated ones (the older, crappier ones will be renovated on soon, but call ahead to see if it's done bc it might take some time), and they were better, BUT my sheets had hair on it and the bathroom was not very clean. Rates for the renovated rooms and the old, crappy ones are the same.If you have no choice but to stay here, make sure you get the hotel to assign the new rooms to you. That said, be prepared for reception to tell you the day that you arrive that those rooms are all taken and they give you one of the crap ones instead. Feb 13 2007 Sadly - Just about as bad as everyone says! I went to the Ashok hoping that the earlier reviewers were just fussy and demanding. Sadly they were simply accurate. An average 3 star hotel trying to be 5 star. The public areas are ok but the rooms are old, tired and dated. Service is patchy and the facilities (shops, restaurants etc) set in something of a time warp!I was able to put up with this and had to stay as a conference was being held at the venue. But others were paying $200 a night - sheer robbery.For a few days relaxation I transferred to the Intercontinental Nehru Place - new hotel different universe. Excellent in every way and the same price as the Ashok. I notice the management at the Ashok have not used the right of reply faciliity on this site. That tells its own story. Avoid unless you enjoy wasting money. Feb 1 2007 A very bad Shock worst hotel ever This was the worst supposedly 5* hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff were extremely rude, food was awful and the rooms were old and grubby. I so wish I had read the reviews before paying £400 for 2 nights. It was most definately an experience to forget. I wrote a letter of complaint to them and suprise suprise I've had no reply. I would recommend that no one should even consider this hotel, you are better off staying somewhere which is 2*We stayed in this hotel to get the best of our last 2 days in India and regretted every minute. It totally left a sour taste in our mouth, we were glad to get back to the UK. Dec 18 2006 Not quite as disturbing as others say it is ...but then again, it is definitely not a good hotel either. I found it to be basic, but ok. Then again, if you think of how much you pay there, it is quite a rip-off. In Europe, I would say, this hotel is ok if you pay not more than 80 EUR a night for a room. Sure, everything is a bit old there and some parts more run down than others, but that is because their furniture is often made from wood and uses carpets where more modern hotels go with more practical furbishing. However, staff was quite friendly, room service quick, and they have a nice outside pool and spa. Also the adjunct restaurants seemed to be alright. But like I said, everything there is just 'alright', which is not good enough for ca. 250 EUR a night. I would probably go there again if my work sent me there, but I would definitely not recommend this as a honeymoon location. It would be fairly disappointing. Dec 1 2006 Never Stay - Read This and see pictures you will know why Hotel Rooms were stinky. It was worst hotel I ever stayed in. I paid 180 $ (INR 8000) for 1 Night.Hotel reception was ok but Rooms are dead.I needed a hotel near US embassy so I unluckily chose this one. Embassy was walking distance. Room was so disgusting that I cant mention it ... I dont have words ... If I write something I am sure tripadvisor.com would bann me .. so I took pictures of the room. Which speak itself ... It's like no comments ... Just check it urself. Room BathRoom - Oh God it was like a 10000 people used public toilet. Dirty like anything, Have pictures of these as well.Regarding Breakfast - It starts at 7 AM, and I was very hungry at 6 AM so I landed at breakfast area at 7:15 AM, nothing was ready on the serving table. I ate some toasts etc by 7:30 AM , by the time I was done 7:55 AM, I saw they started putting lot of other new tasty stuff too. So dont go before 8 AM incase you want to enjoy everything.Never ever stay in this hotel. Nov 20 2006 Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! This hotel is definitely a place where you should not stay even if you had a gun pointed to your head. I did not have the privilege of booking into a hotel of choice as it’s peak season but I did check this website ahead of my trip here. The reviews should have been warning enough as did the candid travelers pictures posted and the PICTURES DO NOT LIE. This hotel classifies itself as a 5 star DELUXE hotel and it probably was, 50 years ago. The exterior looks charming because of the architecture, very colonial but Indian at the same time. However, the inside is a different story.Firstly, upon arrival at 10p.m., there wasn't any porter service and that is quite strange for a 5 star deluxe. Whilst the lobby is clean it looks dated. The LCD TV at the lobby showed nice standard rooms in the TOWER block. I guess the tower block have the newly refurbished or recently cleaned and fumigated rooms, as it appears a FAR CRY from the rooms that were assigned to us (there were 3 of us and all 3 rooms were of similar dismal condition which really defeated the need to ask for a change of room). The key to the room weight at least one pound as it was solid metal and HUGE (the red paint on the key had discolored in parts which tells you how old these are!). Enough to knock anyone out if you threw it at him or her. You need to put the key into the key-hole (turn in clockwise) and at the same time turn the doorknob anti-clockwise before the door opens. The carpets (in the corridor as well as in the room) look as if it had never been changed for the 5 decades since the hotel was built. So old that where it has thined, you can see beneath the carpets and the dust that accumulates there. Where the carpets are completely worn out, a patch of new carpet is fitted on top. There are stains everywhere. Even on the bed sheets. The pillows are hard probably compacted from the years of use!Everything in the bathroom that is metal has rusted. Cannot tell about the metal in the room since the lighting in the room is best suited for nocturnal animals. The toilet seat had a wrapper around it that says `Disinfected for your safety’ and I believe them! Just wondering why they did not disinfect the rest of the room. The flush to the toilet is unique and is a knob that protrudes out of the wall. After turning it round and twisting it, you actually need to use all of your strength to push it in before it flushes as the rust is quite advance. Underneath the dresser there are phone books that say 2006 but look like 100-year old manuscripts. The furniture I don’t even want to describe.If by now you still do not have second thoughts of changing your accommodation, be prepared for the live-in guests that come FREE with the rooms since one night here costs USD200+. Cockroaches. These creatures were everywhere (and in all 3 rooms that we had). They were in the cupboards, on the water bottles supplied, in the toilet and on the towels (so bring your own!). I did not see any on the bed but I would not discount it. I don’t want to know if I had anything else sharing the bed with me (shudder). One night at the Ashok was indeed an experience never to be repeated again. We checked out the next day! Luckily for us, we managed to get a room at another hotel. My advice: Trust the reviews! Nov 20 2006 Noisy My husband &amp; I were booked into the Ashok for many days by his company after another hotel in Delhi fell through. After changing rooms once (the first had twin beds &amp; a damp carpet reeking of insecticides) we wound up with what was probably one of the best rooms in the hotel. Newly renovated, it had laminate wood floors, brand-new bedding, and was generally bright &amp; cheery. HOWEVER, the majority of my husband's colleagues were not so lucky. Their rooms were generally grubby and threadbare. Several reported cockroaches in their rooms, one had bed-bugs, and several had rooms so dirty they had to have housekeeping scrub them twice (and these are generally not picky people). The hotel is also ridiculously noisy. NONE of us slept well because a series of megaphones for a taxi stand outside go on ALL NIGHT LONG broadcasting traffic instructions and call-ups for cabs. It was like trying to sleep in an auction house or an air-traffic controller's room. Sounds of honking outside, the airconditioning vents, and the pounding nightclub downstairs only compounded the problem. What's more, the hotel does stink: of must and exterminator's chemicals. The stench was so bad that before we switched rooms, my husband couldn't sleep because the smell kept him awake, and by the end of our stay, our clothes were saturated with it. Another travesty is the service. Except for the Coffee Shop staff and a smattering of housekeepers, the service ranged from indifferent to rude. When I went to the travel desk to arrange a half-day sightseeing tour, the man there ignored me for five minutes while he chatted on the phone, then told me dismissively, &quot;I'm a very busy man right now. I don't have any cars available. Come back some other time.&quot; When several of my husband's colleagues checked out, the reception staff tried to charge them a higher rate than had been contracted. It was simply outrageous. The Ashok has some great restaurants, an excellent spa, and bags of potential. But the government has got to stop pretending this is a five-star hotel. Probably, it should get out of the hotel business all together. In the hands of a private interest and with some SERIOUS renovations and overhauling the Ashok could live up to the delusions of grandeur currently pictured on its website. But right now, it's an out-of-the-way, run-down, noisy, unappealing, overpriced wreck of a place. Oct 31 2006 A shock at The Ashok As a frequent traveller to Dehli, without a doubt my preferred hotel is The Imperial, or, at the other end of the spectrum, The Park. However, given the lack of rooms in the city I was forced to stay at The Ashok for my last business trip. A SHOCK certainly sums it up! The government run hotel could be a splendid example of traditional Indian grandeur, as its website claims. Sadly, it is not. I checked in late at around 11pm and was greeted by surly receptionists who seemed more interested in getting an imprint of my credit card (for Rs.10,000 - not cheap) than anything else. I was shown to my room by a bellboy so insistent on carrying my one small bag, despite my resistence, that he actually tried grabbing it from me. When I did get to my room, I was mortified. Shabby implies chic nowadays, but this was just shabby. Dirty fingerprinted TV, light switches, toilet seat; tarnished mirrors; dirty cutlery laying around; and the piece de resistance - dark hairs on the pilled pillows and sheets of each of the twin beds. It took three phone calls and a visit by housekeeping to convince them that I didn't want the room, nor did I want to wait for sheets changing, I just wanted to move. The second room seemed more promising, with a fruit basket (and clean knife) but on closer inspection, the beds again were hairy and unappealling. I slept with a pashmina as a pillow and had a terrible night's sleep, especially as after midnight housekeeping called to see if the room was okay; on advising them no, but I cut my losses, they didn't seem to know how to handle it other than saying that the general manager would make it up to me in the morning. Didn't hang around to see what that may involve, but suffice to say, if you have any other choice, don't stay here. What has the potential to be a wonderfully equipped five-star hotel with spacious rooms and a warren of shops and restaurants turned out to be a disappointingly dirty stay in Delhi. Oct 29 2006 don't stay at this hotel in delhi accomodation is terrible. This has got to be the worst hotel ever. The rooms are old and run down. There is a stink in the hallway and staff are generally not very helpful. The only good things are the staff in the restaurant and the breakfast buffet. If you are staying in india, spend a bit more money and stay somewhere else. It cost us $220 a night which is a complete rip off. We were really looking forward to getting out of there. The sheets were dirty and we asked them to change it. Noticed the next day the sheets were the same but changed towards the end of the bed. They don't change your sheets everyday. The electricity cords are dodgy too. It is a gross place to stay and i would avoid it...maybe back in the 60's it was good but not now..sorry to stay but it is the truth..yuk! Sep 24 2006 Overpriced with poor service and grimy rooms! Lesson learned: Never stay at a government-run hotel. The Ashok is a tired, grimy, grubby hotel. The rooms are dirty and dated, the service is surly and unatentive. I couldn't beleive this hotel was given a 5-star rating....until I found out that it was government-run/owned....The Taj hotels (Taj Mahal and Taj Palace) are FAR more pleasant at around the same price. Sep 24 2006 I wish I had checked the reviews I can't believe how bad this hotel has gotten. I originally was here in the early 80s when it was one of the best hotels in Delhi. With the exception of cable TV, I don't think the rooms have been updated since then. The beds are uncomfortable, the hot water is almost non existent, the paint is peeling , the internet service is one of the worst I have had in India and to top it off the food is awful at best and expensive. The sad thing is I originally was excited to be able to stay here after so many years. Between the lousy food, the crappy rooms and the creepy guys (security &amp; maids) in the hallways - this is one hotel to avoid. Jun 5 2006 3* pretend to be 5* We where surprised arriving at 5* hotel, where we found grey towels and bed linen. All over the hotel were signs of government ownership - too much of staff, equipment out of order, etc. I expect for that price you can get much better deal. May 19 2006 Shocking time at the Ashok I was staying at the Ashok hotel between the 11th and 16th of May 2006 for business reasons. During my stay I found the rooms to be unclean and unsafe! whilst moving the hairdryer I received an electric shock. I reported this to the duty manager and asked to speak with the general manager. I was informed that the general manager was in the hotel but was in a meeting and unable to see me! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Apr 16 2006 Hotel to avoid The room was very large, the furniture was grubby and tatty. The bathroom smelled, the bath did not drain, the bidet did not work, the W.C. splashed your trousers when flushed. The mini bar was empty. The balcony was very dirty, paint peeling off wood work and no balcony furniture. The windows were cracked, putty coming away and dangerous to open.The staff were rude, dismissive and unhelpful. I was pushed by one member of staff. The dining room was small and the food below par. There was no bar available to residents (closed for functions). One could not obtain a drink without going into a restaurant.All this for 315$US per night B/B!! Mar 28 2006 Expensive but Worth It Location: In Between Airport, Sites and Central CityService: Above Average Price: High for location, but worth the ratingRoom: Within the rating Mar 4 2006 Not a five star hotel Hotel Ashok is a big hotel in the diplomatic district of new delhi (that is not close to any tourist destination !). it has many restaurants and shops and the lobby is Ok, But Ashok hotel was nothing near being five star. I would rather call it something in between one and two star hotel. &quot;Cleanliness&quot; had no definition in that hotel : my bed sheet was dirty and stained. the minibar refrigirator didn't work and it was empty. The toilette mirror was rusty. I really didn't dare touch anything in that hotel as it seemd that it had not been cleaned for the past 20 years.Although I have to admit that there were two parts in this hotel and the other part seemed to be Ok.I stayed there in Feb. 2006 for 3 nights and I would not be back there ever again. Feb 25 2006 Very disappointed with the rooms and the service We stayed at the Ashok for one night in February as our Tour Company (Compass Tours) told us that the Park hotel was not available due to President Bush's visit to India. We were sent to dirty rooms that seemed like they hadn't been cleaned for weeks. We spent our afternoon trying to get cleaner rooms rather than sight seeing. We finally got some rooms that were a little cleaner than the ones we first saw and ended up staying there. We had paid the same rate as the Park Hotel (we had stayed at the Park earlier in our tour)where the rooms were a 100% better than the Ashok. The management was neither friendly nor helpful. Try to avoid staying here at all cost. Feb 20 2006 Pleasantly surprising stay not as bad as expected We stayed at the Ashok in Feb 06 for 3 nights there was 2 adults, 2 teenangers and a toddler. We stayed in a suite on Floor 5, this was well sized and we had 2 single beds put in the spacious living room. It seemed that there are 2 types of rooms, standard and superior, the superior ones are accessed by marble lined floors, the standard is by carpet. On our floor was an attendant 24/7 who was very attentive. The room was good (uk 4 star std) the bathroom was not as good but adequate. The hotel overall is quite dated but in Delhi is probably quite modern. There is a lot of staff around, who we found very helpful particularly with our toddler. The restaurants are ok, but I would recommend eating out. One night we ate at the hotels Frontier restaurant, food was northern indian fare, very good but at western pricing, later in the week we ate out for the same quality at 1/4 the price. There is a health club which is actually not owned by the hotel, it has very good facilities but if you want to use the gym only, they make you use the basic outdoor changing rooms as opposed to the clubs impressive facilities. Overall we enjoyed our stay but you must try and get a superior room/suite, it is worth paying a bit more. Jan 17 2006 Soviet-Era Luxury Indian Style What a dump. Stay at hotels such as Oberoi which are in a similar price range but deliver first-class amenities and services on all fronts. Jan 13 2006 Business travelers Stay Away General: There is a big gap between terrible and okay but some problems. This property falls somewhere in the middle but closer to bad. Front desk: To small and unorganized to handle more then three guests at a time. Took 25 minutes with a reservation to check in even after I got to interact with the miserable woman working behind the counter. Interior: Carpeting in hallways threadbare and dirty.Room: International plug did not work, no internet cable as purported, and remote was non functional. So working or relaxing was more complicated then it should be. The scale is so big that if the hotel is not full it is almost depressing eating in a 300 person restaurant during the only hour you have with a business guest and you are the only two in the house. Restaurants: Lots of options lots of range in quality. Korean rest was good, Chinese was not so good, the breakfast place could not handle the volume even a small event on the property. The new bar Steel is the best option this place had it was freshly done with good staff that tried and a great relaxed scene. It was the only real haven there where I did not dislike my stay. Conclusion: I travel the world and this was part of a 10 day trip in India and I had much better results at other hotels so this is not about India or cultural differences. Everything in this hotel seemed to be old and tired and interactions with the staff were harder or more complicated than it needed to be. If you do anything other than sleep there as a business guest the frustration took more than it should out of you by the end of the day. It was an exercise in patience all day. Jan 7 2006 like al india needs a clean up the receptionists personel asked my wife how long we are going to stay like they were afraid that we dont have enough money to pay despite the fact that we were coming and go again at the same hotel for a 1 and 1/2 months the rest personel its ok. .the restaurants had a good service except the chinese restaurant which they warm the food for 2nd time before the serve it. Surely it needs a good clean up, change of mattresses, change of all carpets, painting and repairs in the wc....and one more thing....the people in the parking area have to stop shouting through loudspeakers in the middle of the night......all night long...i have changed 6 rooms in this hotel and the situation was more or less the same. the surrounding area is peaceful and clean i wish the same with the hotel Dec 3 2005 Prisoners in the West enjoy better facilities Well, maybe not, because i lack any experience to comment about prison facilities. But i had to wait 52 minutes in the lobby (along with wife, son and a cranky 8 month old daughter and four suitcases) before i could get someone to show me my room. And that was ony after i got into and was the winner of a &quot;shouting&quot; match with the staff. The corridors were dark and I came across some dubious looking people during my one day stay there. The bathroom was of 1940's vintage and the toiletry was very cheap. Room service took forever. The thing that rankled me the most was the could not care less attitude of the staff. They were very grumpy looking and mean and behaved more like they did not really want to be there and did not want you to be there either. I really felt like kicking their backsides. The only saving grace was the performance of the musicians in the restaurant. Needless, to say i left the next day for another hotel. Nov 3 2005 Majestic property....truly Jul 4 2005 Happening Disc Jul 4 2005 best hotel of this region Jul 1 2005 I visited this Palacial hotel first time and liked it lot.

The rooms are big and clean. The service is absolutely fantastic. One morning we left very early to travel to Agra and the staff made sure there was breakfast available (even though the kitchen was meant to be open yet). We ordered room service one evening and the food was with us after 10 minutes and was delicious!The buffet breakfast was included. It was pretty good - selection of hot and cold dishes, Indian and Western. Also, they russle up a great masala omlette!I didn't use it but there is a decent looking outdoor swimming pool.On the down-side: not much of a business centre (1 computer and a fax/printer!) and not centrally located. Apr 4 2009 Pretty Good Stayed here for the final 4 nights of my Delhi trip. The Modern hotel is a good distance out of the city but the Metro link nearby is good. The rooms were very nice. No problem with the mentioned pigeons, room on 7th floor overlooking the park. The Cafe 24 restaurant was quite good and I found the breakfast very satisfactory. The Bar was quiet and nice for a quiet drink in the evening. There was not a lot to dislike bar the overpriced Internet Access which was also very unreliable. The area around the Hotel is not great with some very poor dwellings situated close by. Saying this there was no feeling of danger while walking the area. Nov 13 2008 Never Again In the middle of nowhere. 45mins into delhi town, just feels like a lifetime with the taxi drivers.American breakfast!!!!!!! Have I got it wrong, do Americans now have curry and ommlette for breakfast.?As I was there on business I required internet access, this was unavailable for 2 days and when it was available I learnt that the whole of the hotel has only purchased around 9 hours for a 15 day period! I was aware that internet was chargable so was surprised to learn that the maximum logon was 43mins.Swimming pool was unavailable.Restaurants consist of 1 with 2 menus, food was not greatBar area was so dimly lit it was like sitting in a mine with no atmosphere.Staff not very helpfull.Expensive in comparison to many others in better positions.Left a day early, I would not recommend this hotel and if my PA was not my wife I would sack her Oct 31 2008 Great Place To Stay The place is lovely, the staf are great and the food fantastic but expensive.The only other issue was the expensive internet connection Oct 9 2008 Peaceful haven in Delhi! City Park is a modern 7-storey hotel on the northern edge of Delhi. To get the negative out the way first, it is a bit isolated, but it is easy to order a tuctuc or taxi. However, as the name suggests, there is a park opposite, so views from many rooms are quite relaxing, which counts for a lot in somewhere as manic as Delhi, and of course that also reduces the street noise. And it is easily accessible by the main routes in and around Delhi. This hotel is easily up to 4* European standards, close to 5*. Rooms are very large, the beds soft, the aircon quiet, the bathrooms well equipped and clean. Welcome cake, water and fruit a nice touch, particularly after a long flight or drive. The Chilli restaurant food was really very good, plentiful and reasonably priced at about £3-4 for a main dish, but the beer very pricey, £3/bottle, 50% more than most restaurant prices, and the service we received was a bit slow and staff seemed completely thrown because we changed the number of people on our reservation. There's a pool in summer, which is welcome. The extensive banquetting facilities also give an indication of the hotole's quality. Great for a stopover or a few days. Jul 20 2008 Poor Location But Clean Clean rooms, seemed far from the city, decent breakfast and good gym (for India). Basic business hotel. We stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks and each time the Internet was down which was pretty annoying. May 1 2008 Sleepless night We stayed for one night at this hotel on the first leg of the Golden Triangle tour, therefore this hotel was booked for us by our tour operator.Much to our disappointment, the hotel was a good 1.5 to 2 hours drive from the centre of Delhi. Some members of our Group had previously arranged to eat out in Delhi, but this would not have been possible. There was nothing much to do in the vicinity of the hotel.We ate in the hotel restaurant. The food was very nice, though terribly expensive even by London standards.The biggest problem we had was that of sleep (or lack of). After travelling for around 36 hours and with only a few hours sleep on the plane, we were hoping for a good night's sleep here.During the night, my wife and I thought someone was on the balcony trying to break in, until we discovered that around 10 to 15 pigeons were sitting on the balcony banging against the bedroom window.A bigger nuisance, however, was that a wedding was taking place at the hotel that night and at around 11pm they congregated in the car park below our balcony. They played drums and trumpets loudly until 2.30am. At midnight I called reception asking to change room, but my request was denied (only to find out in the morning that other guests had moved rooms during the night).The following morning we complained to the staff at reception who were totally disinterested in what I had to say. They offered to change our room.....even though we were in the process of checking out!Breakfast might have been good, but I was in such a grumpy mood that I couldn't possibly comment on it objectively! The butter was rock solid and was unspreadable- that's about as much as I remember.I would not stay there again. Apr 29 2008 pleasant hotel in dubious area We stayed in this hotel twice, one night at the start of our tour, and then again just before we were due to fly out of Delhi. On our first visit we were put into rooms on a lower floor, and the pigeon problem others have mentioned wasn't too obvious. However on our final night we were roomed on the 7th floor and they were a thorough nuisance - flying into the windows, and constantly moving around during the night. The area around the hotel is not one that you would feel safe exploring, though lots of people seemed to be socialising quite happily in the park across the road. The hotel is so far out of the city centre that it is difficult to use as a base for your own sightseeing. We got a map from reception and realised that we were almost off the map of central Delhi. Like us, most of the guests seemed to be on tours and they only stay here briefly. A previous poster has mentioned dirty carpets - I think we must have stayed in the room after them as our carpets had obviously just been washed and were still a little damp. However - there are lots of pluses for this hotel. We found the staff pleasant and trying hard to be helpful. They did get overwhelmed at checkout time, as all guests are being picked up together. The staff in the bar were really nice, though we found the drinks pricey on Indian standards. The coffee shop downstairs was a pleasant place for breakfast, plenty of choice, though we didn't discover that eggs would be cooked to order on our first visit - just ask and the chef will appear. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel - as long as you are using it as a brief base you will find it quite adequate for you needs. Apr 19 2008 Depressing setting This was part of the Golden Triangle Trip (so Hotels booked for us)&amp; we had stayed at The Oberoi Maidens, Delhi for 3 nights at the beginning (which was excellent) so this Hotel was depressing, by comparison-even though the food was fine.There was nowhere to walk to -the Cinema &quot;complex&quot;next door was bleak &amp; semi derelict. There is a slum just next to it (with, we were told, Bangladesh refugees) with sludge/sewage/junk on the pavement - so it seems a bit spoilt of us to complain about the Hotel-neverthelessthe carpet in the bedroom was covered in stains. It also felt a bit malevolant outside-as men were being sleazy (to me-a female even tho walking with my husband in daylight) &amp; it was very noisy at night with shouting/car alarms &amp; pigeons/dogs (as others have said)..A highlight was an Extreme Sport chipmunk which sky-dived down from the roof of the Hotel Tower block &amp; swam across the swimming pool! Jan 22 2008 Rude Unfriendly Staff Bad Breakfast Annoying Pigeons on Balcony The tour company (Hi-Tours) put us in this hotel for two nights. We had stayed at another budget hotel in Delhi on our own where we had a good experience (Silver Ferns). The City Park is totally remote, far from anything and the former mall next door is empty except for a cookie store and an optical shop. We did not feel safe when we walked in the neighborhood. Our room overlooked a rubble filled parking lot behind the mall, and the balcony was full of loud pigeons cooing and pooping everywhere. Dogs barked tor hours in the night. The staff was rude and inefficient. I waited in line for 15 minutes to pay my bill on leaving because the person in front of me had questions about her bill. Six employees devoted all of their time to her and totally ignored me except to tell me to &quot;have a seat.&quot; The breakfast was tourist oriented and the service was slow. The room was adequate but I can't recommend this place for anyone. Dec 28 2007 Great for a brief stopover This hotel was arranged for us as part of a tour so we didn't have any choice in where we stayed, but we weren't disappointed. We arrived in the evening, having spent most of the day travelling up from Goa, and the day had been a bit fraught due to delayed flights and the possibility of missing our connection (which we didn't, thanks to tremendous efficiency by Kingfisher Airlines staff). The hotel was clean, comfortable and had the best bed out of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our 2 week trip.Because we arrived quite late, we didn't bother to go out but just had a few drinks and a snack in the hotel bar. Food and drinks were okay.On the down side, there were pigeons on the railings outside our window and we were woken up at 4 am by what sounded like tap dancing - it was the pigeons being restless. The swimming pool looked nice although the water was a bit cloudy. Some people might also be put off by the fact that the pigeons were also sitting along the edge, having a bath in the water!Breakfast was good, although for a country known for its tea, I wasn't impressed - far too weak and wishy washy!The one problem we encountered was a small visitor in our room. I saw something scuttling along the floor and thought it was an insect. My husband saw it and realised it was a small mouse - on the 7th floor! The hotel staff were amazed when we reported this but hopefully, they dealt with it as soon as we checked out. Dec 10 2007 Lovely Hoetl We stayed at City park as part of a tour around india. I have no idea how much it costs but it terms of decor and space it was brilliant. The rooms were big with all modern ammenities. It is quite far from the very centre of delhi but you get taxi's everywhere anyway. The manager was very friendly and made sure we had a good time. Just be aware that everyone wants a tip, just say thank you and close the door. Nice hotel. Dec 6 2007 Nice hotel to stay in and to get a great exp. A 4 star hotel having all the 5star facilities and amenities at a great price,will love to stay here again on my next visit to delhi, staff was very friendly and helpful the environment with in a hotel was gud,and food was excellent specially yellow chilli......an indian restaurant...... Jan 24 2007 I recommend City Park I was booked at the Jaypee Siddarth; however, despite having a confirmed reservation, I was rebooked at the City Park Hotel. I am glad. While it is not the most centrally located, the rooms are clean and the customer service is exceptional. I will definitely stay here again and the prices are reasonable - a rarety in India where hotel prices are unreal. Jan 11 2007 Lovely to look but beware..... We found ourselves at the City Park for one night in between internal flights in India. Hotel space in Delhi is at a premium so we were glad to get a central(ish) room in a supposedly good four star hotel. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival as the lobby and surrounding areas looked welcoming, spacious and well laid out. The staff at check in were cordial rather than friendly. Our departure next morning was early and we had to be at the airport for around 6.00 a.m. so the car was coming to pick us up at 5.00.We had our young daughter with us and didn't want her to travel on an empty stomach so we made arrangements for a small breakfast before we left. We were assured it would be there. Their full breakfast, which we had paid for doesn't start till after 6.30. When we arrived downstairs the following morning the cafe was shut and the manager wanted to charge us for providing a sandwich from room service to take with us. All they would provide was a cup of tea or coffee and toast and bits of fruit There was no flight information which a lot of hotels (4 star and upwards have). In short no one cared.So I would say looks can be deceptive and if you don't want to be done - avoid this hotel. This is a 4 star hotel with 0 star customer care standards. Oct 20 2006 pleasant oasis in the suberbs A little way out of the city centre and set amid tumble down houses and shops, this hotel is an adequate stop over. It has two restaraunts and a spa. (the aruvedic massages are cheaper then in Kerala with a one hour massage for 600 inr plus tax). The hotel derives its name from a city park directly opposite which provides a pleasant area to walk without the hassle of New Delhi streets. Unfortunately open public urinals line the side of the street and the smell can be over powering on a hot day. Rooms are well appointed and the beds are comfortable. Apr 13 2006 Great Hotel - Far Away This is an excellent hotel. The front desk staff were very good, the food was good (breakfast was fair, but the dinners were excellent), and the room was clean. Laundry service was prompt and very good as well. It is just not in a very good location. It is very far from the main part of the city - it took me 1-1/2 hours from the airport, 1-1/2 hours to meet a friend at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, and 1-1/2 hours to the Baha'i Temple. I spent a lot of time in a car on the crazy roads of Delhi. There is wireless Internet access in the rooms, but its is very slow, and I had to sit near the door to get a signal. Mar 18 2006 Too Far from the Main Delhi Attractions Expensive If you are looking to do some sight seeing in Delhi, do not stay here, its in one end of Delhi (extreme North) far from the main attractions and you will get far better services and grandness with hotels in South/Central part of Delhi at lesser or comparable price. Its lobby and public areas are far smaller than most other 5 stars in Delhi and is located on a relatively smaller street in front. The distance of Delhi's main attractions like Lodhi Gardens, India Gate, Bahai Temple, Old Fort is atleast 20Kms from here and you can end up spending a 1-2 hours to travel in peak hours (one way). The only place which is closeby (relatively only) is some of the Old Delhi attractions about 12-15Kms from this place but then its the same from the hotels in Central/South Delhi as well. There is absolutely no attraction around this hotel.This hotel also has mind boggling banquet business where marriages/family functions are organized making it a nuisance for the residents because of the noise and people which frequent in 100s all on a single day. It has atleast 3-4 banquets halls.This hotel is located in a North Delhi residential area while most of Delhi's other good hotels are located in posh south delhi localities. Jan 3 2006 city park we stayed here as the 1st night of our golden triangle tour. it wasthe best of the 3 hotels we stayed at - very clean, good rooms, and good service. the breakfast was not so good but we got much more than we expected.it was overall excellentand i will definitely sty here again on my next visit to delhi Dec 28 2005 A sound hotel with an excellent restaurant We stayed in 5 hotels whilst in India and this was one of the best. It is very much a hotel catering for the business traveller, however, if you want to get into the centre of Delhi it will take around an hour due to the shear volume of traffic.The rooms are clean, are well decorated and a good size. The restaurant was excellent and probably one of the best we ate at in India!!There is also the usual facilities at the hotel, Gym, swimming pool, 24hr room service etc.A previous review of the hotel commented on &quot;tipping&quot; and staff holding out their cupped hands. We didnt experience this at this hotel, however, it is a very common trait in India.No real complaints about the hotel. Oct 22 2005 Do not pay to sufffer - Never Again We were on a World trip in April through to June 2006. We saw this Hotel rated as a 5 star and recommended by all major airlines. Whilst in the Hotel, we were advised NOT to drink the water, let water when showering enter your mouth, eat washed fruit or any salads. Strange for a 5 star which should have had water purification.All staff were atttentive but held out their hands to make their wages, not tips. Other people we met in the Hotel had the same experience. All staff were underpaid yet room rates were from US$200 per night. One would bring 1 towel, get a tip and return with a helper and another towel and want more money for his return PLUS his mate. Then flowers, then soap, then more bottled water at US$4 per bottle. We met several others with the same experience and they paid more than us.Tthe owners ate in the restaurant and when they did, all staff left us and other guests and served he owners who did not care. I saw the owner's wife order six drinks in succession as she just changed her mind, sent the untouched drinks away and was so rude to the staff I could not but interupt and tell her off. She said we could leave the Hotel if we did not like it. How rude! as she was just so disgusting and I have not seen animalss treated the way she treated her staff.Everything organised from the Hotel was upwards of 5 times the price of anywhere else. they were renovating with jackhammers from 6am up to 10pm every night and regardless of complaints, ignored us and other guests who were lined up to complain.I felt sorry for the staff who tried so hard, but the management despised their guests, and their staff.I wrote to this Hotel and the Airlines who recommended it because I want to make sure others do not pay to suffer. Not even a reply.Never again!Marcus Sep 28 2006 Ottimo e bellissimo\", doc_id='af0c99c2-d1ce-4eef-baf7-3b770eeb3d11', embedding=None, doc_hash='e46db6de70978b60f9f71c6ae06e527fe14e4757a884c32e552908938e555bfd', extra_info=None)], [Document(text=\"Jun 15 2009 Service was atrocious; creepy place for women to stay My friend and I stayed here as part of a Gecko's tour. Our room was cleaner than the Hotel Perfect (see my other review) but what really was astonishingly bad was the service. The staff were intent on a) getting tips from us and b) entering our room for various &quot;reasons&quot;. At one point one of the staff knocked on our door to tell us they had beer for sale (!). Each time we opened the door they tried to get into the room and I had to stand directly at the door to prevent this. When we arrived we offered the porter the standard tip for each bag that he carried to the room but he tried to tell us that it wasn't enough and even went so far as to take a 10 rupee note out of my hand without my permission! They scowled at any tip we offered for service and when we were in the cab just about to leave for the airport out of the blue they raised the cost of the taxi by 50 rupees! Stay in a nicer place, you deserve it! May 22 2009 Best hotel in the area Stayed for 3 nights. The room was clean and the staff was the best. They also had amazing food from room service. Quiet at night as well and close to the markets.Do check out punjab sweets as well. Good hotel, would recommend to anyone. The staff was exceptional. Oh and they also had Wi-Fi. Jan 21 2009 Basic but good value We stayed here for 5 nights in total (spread over three separate visits). It was organized for us as a part of a car and driver trip. It is what I would call a basic 3 star hotel. The room was clean and well serviced. While it didn’t have a window (looked onto an airshaft) it was quiet. Breakfast was included in our package, was served in the room and was OK. Could have upgraded it at an extra cost. Staff were friendly and helpful. The bed only had a bottom sheet and blanket but staff were happy to provide a top sheet.Location is OK. Relatively quiet street with markets at one end of street. A number of reasonable restaurants in the street and internet cafes nearby. Felt quite safe walking around in the evening. Is a 10 minute autorickshaw ride from Connaught Place. Autorickshaw drivers have trouble finding it so make sure you take a hotel business card with you. Nov 27 2008 DISGUSTING DUMP This was the worst hotel experience in my life and I have been to about 60 countries during my travelling time. There was supposed to be an airport pickup in the deal - that did not happen and neither did I get a refund on my taxi fare to the hotel. Breakfast was supposed to be included and that did not happen either. The room had NO windows, the bed had a bottom sheet and on the top was just a blanket - no top sheet. I was supposed to stay 2 nights but I took a taxi into town and got a flight out of India for the next day. I was charged double the fee back to the airport than the amount I paid for a taxi to the hotel as well and it was driven by someone connected to the hotel. This hotel was listed on an International Hotel site and I have written to them about my concerns about this place and note that they are no longer on that site and for the sake of other unfortunate travellers like myself I am glad at least for that. Oct 28 2008 A good middle range business/tourist hotel This was our first stop in India and was organised through the tour company. There was nothing wrong with this hotel, the rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and honest, and the location was quiet at night.I left all of my valuables, which amounted to a few thousand dollars US, in the care of the front desk. I was a bit worried when they didn't give me any receipt but shoved it in a locked draw. No problems when I got it back as everything was still there.It was only about 50m away from the main shopping street and if you need a landmark then &quot;Punjabi Sweets&quot;, a very busy street side eatery, is in the same lane.\", doc_id='f4fdb178-66b7-4b72-9010-db57f6031a3b', embedding=None, doc_hash='9ed73f50680c9ffbbe2331e55345ba7c54a36c8196e95028a6bf2a970f61a3cd', extra_info=None)], [Document(text=\"good value for money i was at Clark heights to meet my girl friend came from Dubai. First i was very hazy about where she is staying. after reaching there we have found that safe and nice pl;ace. in the main city off course nosiy like Delhi. Under one roof all the services available for the travelers. From Pick Up to Drop.I would recommend to every one Nov 22 2009 Adequate rooms friendly staff but beware of being ripped off! The rooms in this hotel were adequate though super super deluxe far nicer and more spacious than lesser rooms. Not great value for money and very noisy due to construction work and the busy road outside. Staff on reception were nice and friendly, with the exception of the travel agent who charged extortionate prices for hiring hotel taxis and double charged us (service charge) for booking train tickets to Amritsar. We were also told that Delhi was closed on a Friday in order to sell us a trip out of Delhi, when in reality it wasn't! This gave us a bad impression of the hotel as a whole. Nov 22 2009 Don't stay at this hotel. Rooms were ok, but everything else was terrible about this place. The staff changed their pricing on us many times (and of course, they over charged us). They don't have a restuarant although they say they do. Instead if you order something, they will just find it on the street and bring it to your room. Every person you see in the hotel expects a high tip for doing nothing. They say they have internet, but it is the computer they use at the front desk. Overall, this was the worst place I have stay at in India and the price was one of the highest. Nov 21 2009 safe place We booked 10 rooms for the marriage purpose for three nights stay. Hotel staff was very helpful speciall the lady at reservation helped us alot in arranging the batchlores party at the basement. This was very near to our house and the marriage location. all aur family members came form different parts enjoyed and cherish the stay over there. Nov 20 2009 Average hotel but lots of hidden costs We stayed at Clark Heights for 5 days in November. Original my boyfriend and I were given the wrong room - we had paod for a super deluxe but they put us in a delux - after arguing our case they graciously put us in a much better room. Some of the staff were very nice but we were charged extortionaly for organising taxis with the hotel (including a car to Agra) and service charge on train tickets were high. Recommend to get Rickshaws than use their taxis. Overall a noisey but average hotel. Nov 18 2009 Poor value for money This hotel was nothing special. Firstly, it is currently undergoing building works so you are staying on a construction site. The rooms were basic. The reception staff were helpful, except for the woman who arranged our trip to Agra and Amritsar - she ripped us off and then told us we were untrustworthy when we refused to pay charges that she hadn't told us about. This was after she had told us that the whole of Delhi would be closed on one of our days there, which we found out later wasn't true. There was always someone available to drive us places, though at an expensive cost. All in all, we weren't very impressed with this hotel and if you do stay here, don't book any trips without negotiating the price first. Nov 15 2009 Seepage in the Room Paying more money than the nearly hotels we expected more standard butthere was seepage in our rooms and it was smelling. We do notunderstand as to then give the room to customers. Oct 29 2009 No Limit for cheating. I book room from internet. No pick up and no refund. 80 Kms. small taxi for 15 Rs. 1 km. cheating travelers coming for 1st time to india. High price hotel/ guest house. Oct 28 2009 Good value and nice location We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel has a nice location - yes, there is noise from the streets - but nothing you couldn`t live with.Friendly staff an ok restaurant with cheap food. Oct 23 2009 Love the hotel location I was there in months of september with my father. I would like to share my views abouth clark heights. I personally feel this hotel is good for those people who visit first time in india bcoz here, I found very helpful and caring people and they helped me in my further tour as well and very well organized by the hotel staff. The rooms are very nice and specious I love to give **** star for this hotel. Only problem with our taxi driver that is he was to fast.I like this hotel bcoz of the location of the hotel in on the main road and they have there own parking facilities plus market is also very near to this place. Here, Reception staff is extremely helpful and well behave... Oct 21 2009 i m loving it as i wnt to d hotel i was really impresd by the intrir.................the staff was really good and coperative..............i enjoyed hotel.........the food i had there was delisious....... Oct 11 2009 Noisy The hotel was clean, room mid size.No pick up at the airport. Very noisy all night.Staff was nice location was ok; we prepaid 250 IR for a car taxi from airport Oct 10 2009 Truly home away from home. The experience at clark was better than any five star hotel I v stayed in and I v stayed in many as I m a flight attendant . The rooms are way bigger n nicer than most. The staff was incredibly attentive and caring .(especially to my kids who did nt want step out of the hotel as they were so at home there.) The food was divine. and they took every care to cater to my kids' special 'out of menu' orders. All my out of town tours to Amritsar n Agra were very well arranged.The only thing I think They could improve upon is the toilet ameneties and external facade. Oct 10 2009 Constantly mislead me I arrived in Nov in Delhi with my family. We booked hotel clarck online because it was easy. As expected we were picked up at the airport. The rooms were not as nice as the photos online, at all. We arrived late so had little choice. the y cheat us badly......... Oct 6 2009 Wrong Presentation I booked this hotel on a friend’s recommendation and after looking the reviews on trip advisor. The hotel is not clean 25 % of what it is displayed as. The staff is just eager to sell you tour to Agra and Jaipur. There ware small insects in the room, the bathroom has a foul smell. The hotel is on a busy road so we had no sleep the whole night. Charge is quit high compared to the services. We do not recommend it to any traveler from USA or Europe. Sep 24 2009 It's completely of the type i would prefer...... I enjoyed a great 2-days stay over there with my colleagues. The interior of the hotel is very impressive and I must give a special compliment 2 the hotel staff too because they managed it very well. The service is really upto the mark and moreover, what I liked the most is its location. I mean its too easy to get to other places from here which was our prime requirement during that trip. And, getting all this at so reasonable price is none less than a pleasant surprise. Infact, I am looking forward to more stays in CLARK HEIGHTS during my future trips to Delhi. I would definitely refer this hotels to all my friends....:)) Sep 14 2009 Excellent service pleasant and helpful staff Warm ambience Hi ,I visted india in month of aug, with few freinds fro a wedding, Since we wanted to stay closer to central delhi and were on abudget , we chose this hotel.Good value for money.The staff was courteous , freindly and very helpful. The rooms were nicely done and clean. The late night coffe shop was a blessing for us due to late night at wedding function.The staff even helped us in getting few things that we had missed to carry along.,They even got our gifts packed in a very elegant way.I would recommend thsi hotel to all my friends from US. and would definately go back and stay ther.e everytime i visit Delhi. Jul 31 2009 Awesome simply Awesome I had been to hotel Clark Height in the month of JUNE. I stayed their for 2 nights and 3 days. I must say its the best place have never been i mean the staff was excellent. specially ma fav place there the roof top restaurant such a pleasant place , 24hrs coffee shop, service were at the best and delicious food too. Rooms were quite clean and Comfortable and a king size bed to relax urself. Infrastructure is beautifully designed, internet facilities provided by the hotel was the best the speed was good and i can do my work without any interruption where else at other place i have to pay around 100 Rs. for the same really a helpful atmoshpere. In short will say its a Awesome place and next whenever i m gonna come Delhi my stay will be definetly der at Hotel Clark Height Jun 21 2009 Run Away Many time you think for the best but you get nothing and you get bad experience yes I had a bad experience as the room given to me was very dirty and towel was smelling.I booked this hotel from internet as the hotel fails to pickup me from airport even the service at night was not good. Big ManMushtaq Jun 13 2009 AWSOME HOTEL I went to india last month for a business trip and stayed at Hotel Clark Heights.It was a wonderful experience.Room was immaculately clean, the bedding and pillows were heavenly , the bathroom and dressing area was very nice, and a separate space for an office desk and chair.. A lovely hotel. All staff went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant.Enjoyed my visit. I would definitely go back. Apr 12 2009 Excellent hospitality and food We just returned from a 6 nights stay at Clark Heights hotel at New Delhi. Being from India, I am much familiar to the issues which some hotels in India have and I must say, both my wife and I were thoroughly pleased with the service and the room that this hotel provided us. It is in a crowded road, but accessible to the mero which is about a km away in walking. The best part of this hotel was that it was very clean and the bathrooms were sparkling and fresh. The double delux room is a bit small, but we found it quiet, as it was the corner room for us. The room service and special requests were immediately taken care of. The other thing which we thoroughly enjoyed here was the food. Since we had a six year old son with us who we have not trained to eat spicy food, we asked the cook(chef) to make sure that there is no spice. That was always complied with. The menu is mostly North Indian food with some Chinese and Continental options also. They even packed sandwiches for us in the early hours(4am) of the morning when we were to go to Agra. The food was so tasty, that at times while sight-seeing in Delhi, we used to head back for lunch to the hotel just to have the food. (There is a famous four-start hotel in Connaught place whose restaurant refused to make food with no spice, so we had to walk out). The basement retsaurant is used for lunch and the roof is now made into a roof-top restaurant and the open-air was very pleasant. We can see the metro line and the moving trains from the roof-restaurant, something my son enjoyed. My only wishlist is that the hotel must tie up with a more reliable cab-service, we had some concerns with the car on one of the days(got an inexperienced driver once - a bit dangerous for Delhi traffic, so we stopped the car after couple of minutes and got another reliable driver whom we stuck to), but otherwise pickups from airport and drops went on plan. Overall, a good experience and if we visit Delhi again, for this price, it is a good stay. Feb 24 2009 Decent Hotel Great Staff This is decent hotel if you want to live around patel nagar, but it is on a very busy intersection, so be carefull to while booking room. Do not book room by metra side, or you will not be able to sleep. Hotel staff was very good. I had an issue with my rental car and I had to call 1000 KM away and my cell phone gave up because it was changing network. Receptioninst lady gave me her own cell phone to use as it was early in the morning. Accept one minor incident of overcharging by room service(This was corrected by front desk right away and they apologized so I will believe it was just a mistake.). Rooms are clean, bathroom is great with international standard and property is very clean. Jan 20 2009 cleancomfortable and friendly. First time in India and after a poor night in Mumbai I was pleasantly surprised by the Clark Heights hotel. Convenient to the Delhi Metro I found no difficulty getting around.The hotel room was clean and well appointed with a flat panel TV.\", doc_id='930f0e84-ccdd-431a-975d-9acb60eef318', embedding=None, doc_hash='ff7cf6aa34077d3e9a0772efdffa7be757cff4e0c88500034d9db6358457d342', extra_info=None)], [Document(text=\"Good but noisy We stayed only one night and our room was close to the reception. All the noise from the hall way and reception could clearly be heard in our room all night. Also there were some cat fights under the window providing more noise. Try to get a room far away from the reception and/or wear earplugs.Eevrything else worked OK. Nov 20 2009 Good Place to Stay This hotel is fairly small but well sited in the middle of Delhi in Connaught Place. Rooms are variable in size but well appointed for us.Staff areexcellent and very helpful, whilst the attached restaurant has excellent food and service.Connaught Place itself is undergoing extensive restoration, so there is quite a bit of mess in the area.Only trouble with the hotel is that is no lounge area for friends to meet, but you can use the restaurant for this purpose without difficulty. Nov 19 2009 Centrally located clean and with a good restaurant As with other reviews the driver was unsure exactly where this hotel was on Connaught Circus. I recognised it as It looked exactly like the pictures on tripadvisor. Greeting was pleasant, room was small but clean and well appointed. Restaurant was excellent. Location was so central for that part of Delhi with plenty of shops, clubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk.There was some noise, perhaps from the cinema, but it wasn't unbearable. I'd definitely stay here again.By the way don't think about visiting the (fairly nearby) Indian Coffee House - what a dump! Nov 15 2009 Clean rooms great service good location and value The staff were very attentive and our room was exceptionally clean. It was also quiet which was great as it was daylight when we finally got to sleep, due to jet lag, yet we didn't hear any of the usual daytime traffic noise. The hotel was also kind enough to store one of our bags for a week while we visited some cities in Rajastan. Overall, a very enjoyable stay at a great price - Don't be put off by the exterior, it's great inside. Nov 13 2009 Took our money and left us stranded on the streets of delhi at night! My husband and I have traveled widely around India, yet nothing prepared us for the predicament we faced when we booked in to this hotel! Having consulted TripAdvisor and seen the high rating of Hotel Palace Heights we clicked on the booking which led us to hotels.com (expedia.in) through which we booked this hotel for 2 nights. Our booking confirmation from hotels .com came through and my husband's credit card was charged the full amount. We took a print out of the confirmation and having travelled via train from shimla we arrived at new delhi at 10 pm at night to be met with bewilderment at the front desk of the hotel palace heights! They saw our booking confirmation and said that they had not received any booking and that they had no rooms available for us. Without any apology they said that it must have been hotels.com's fault as they had NOT RECEIVED ANY BOOKING! We being visitors to Delhi did not know what to do next. Attempts to reach hotel.com at that hour failed so we were left in a dilemma as to where to spend the night. We eventually did manage to find an overpriced and badly located hotel later that night but our trip had been ruined by our experience.Hotel.com say its the hotels's fault and they have our money which HAS NOT YET BEEN refunded nearly three weeks after the incident! To sum it up : THIS HOTEL IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL BUT UNTRUSTWORTHY and brings this website's recommendations into disrepute. Be warned that if you book this hotel through this site you too may end up in our predicament, having to pay for a room that you are unable to stay in and with weeks of trouble trying to reclaim the money in vain. Nov 3 2009 Excellent Value I stayed at this hotel for one night in November. It was difficult for my taxi driver to find the hotel, and from the outside it doesn't look that great, but the rooms inside are great, with a modern and clean decor, flat panel TV, and a lovely bathroom. They're not huge rooms, but they're very comfortable. The location is perfectly central, there are loads of shops, restaurants, and ATMs when you step out of the hotel. All the staff, from reception to housekeeping, are very courteous and helpful. The food in the restaurant, Zaffran, is wonderful, and the service in there is also exemplary. There is also complimentary water, fruit and internet, and a welcome juice. I would rate this as higher than a 3 star. Also, just a note -- I ate all the fresh fruit provided in the room and got more when i finished. It was good to eat fruit that i could trust. Oct 31 2009 Nice Place for tourists/night stay. I visited Delhi as a tourist with my spouse and young kids. I didn't want to pay a very high price just for the few nights stay in a typical 5 star hotels, so I chose this hotel based on other reviews. All we needed a night stay in a safe, clean and comfortable place. Although little higher on the price side for what it offers (not very big, but ok size rooms). Location is perfect and rooms were very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was immaculate. Most site seeing locations are closer to this place and central park, Metro station is right there. Restaurant is also fabulous. Overall very nice experience and would recommend with high ratings. Free wireless Internet service. For vehicles, Parking on the streets, free of charge but not very difficult to find. Oct 27 2009 very comfortable and excellent restaurant The Hotel is very central. The room we had was clean and we were able to sleep 3 in the room. it is an expensive hotel, but worth it for the restaurant and its central position. The staff were extremely helpful, even to the extent of accompnaying us to find an ATM which worked. Oct 26 2009 Excellent Good Value Down Town Hotel Great location right in the heart of Connaught Place and close to the metro station. (Beware though, that because the hotel is quite small and with no street frontage to speak of, taxi drivers may not know where it is).The two best things about this hotel were the restaurant - great at both breakfast and dinner (some of the best food I've ever had in India) - and the enthusiasm of the staff and their willingness to help with everything.Rooms are well appointed and confortable. althougha bit on the small side. The AC can be a bit aggressive and in our room we were forced to turning it off during the night so as to avoid being too cold. However, that's a minor niggle.Internet worked fine and was reasonably fast.The only negative aspect was that having booked another couple of nights for the following week, we were informed the evening before we left that they were unable to honour these extra nights. Had I not gone to the desk to book a taxi for the following morning, I suspect that I wouldn't have found this out until too late.Good value for Delhi. Overall, recommended. Oct 25 2009 Clean modern hotel We stayed for 3 nights in late June and then for one night in early July on our way back home. The hotel was modern and very clean. The AC worked very well and it was a good escape from the very hot temps outside. Rooms were on the small side and there isn't much of a lobby, so if you wanted to sit around/linger this isn't really the place to do that. Our first room faced an interior air shaft/courtyard but the second one faced a side street. Staff was friendly and helpful and we met the owner one night who was also very pleasant and accommodating. Breakfast is included and there were both western (eggs, pancakes) options and Indian options. There isn't much to see in Connaught Place, but there are many restaurants in walking distance. It was strange to walk out on our first night for dinner and be one of the few people in the street in what is considered the center of town. The hotel arranged a car to pick us up at the hotel and the driver (Bobby) was nice but tried to sell us on his tour guide services the entire ride to the hotel. He even tried to take us to his office BEFORE dropping us off at the hotel, but we politely declined saying that after such a long trip we just wanted to get to the hotel and shower/sleep. This worked and he took us to the hotel. Because he was so friendly and seemed like a good guide we hired him to drive us around on a tour of Delhi a couple of days later and he barely spoke throughout the entire day that we spent with him. It seems he used all of his Delhi facts to get us to book with him and once we did he didn't have much more to say. His company seems to work exclusively with Hotel Palace Heights, so beware when booking tours through the hotel. He was nice and honest, but didn't offer much in way of a tour. Overall, the hotel experience was a good one. If what you're looking for is a modern, clean and safe hotel in the &quot;center&quot; of Delhi, then you can't go wrong with Hotel Palace Heights. Sep 1 2009 perfect service I stayed end of august (29.08.09) in this hotel in Delhi - and it was simply perfect!!! You can't ask for a nicer, welcoming service. Everybody from the staff was very friendly and tried to help in every way - from access to internet, to phoning at the agency where I've had booked an ac-cab for a sight seeing tour that didn't show up. The receptionist made it come in less than 5 minutes 8after I've waited half an hour in vain). M. Wasim at the reception desk was extremely kind, and also his colleague who was on duty after his shift.I only can recommend this hotel. Connaught place is in the very heart of Delhi, the rooms are comfortable, have European standard, what a pleasure to find a nice and clean bathroom after a travel through the Himalayas. a welcome drink (juice, of course it's India after all) was offered as well as a fruit basket. It was simply perfect. Aug 24 2009 Definitively my favorite place in Norther India! I stayed in India three weeks visiting Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Mumbay. I spent two nights at Palace Heights at the beginning of my trip and two at the end. The staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and efficient, making you feeling at home (if not even better!). The service is professional, discrete and very efficient. They arrange perfect tours and transfers from/to the airport. The hotel is a quiet oasis in the heart of Delhi, with clean rooms furnished in a contemporary design style. The restaurant is one of the best I tried in India, cozy and relaxing. You buy a five star quality hotel at the price of a three star! A modern and confortable hotel with a strong personality! Jul 12 2009 Expensive/Annoying for the price We could hear incessant banging in the first TWO rooms they put us in. After finally getting settled into a quiet room, we put on the do not disturb sign, but people kept calling and knocking on the door to give us things like cookies - nice, but annoying. They also pressured us into using their travel agent for a tour to the Taj Mahal. The car and driver was over priced and had barely working A/C. The driver didn't really talk to us (for the 2 hour there and 3 hour back drive) and kept making us go places to buy stuff (we didn't but he stopped anyway). The car didn't have seat belts. The staff at the hotel also told us differing info on how much things were going to cost and Monday through Friday the electricity goes on and off every so often. Jun 9 2009 Nice but expensive hotel We stayed two nights at Hotel Palace Height. The hotel is expensive for the size of the room &amp; bathroom we had. The view from the hotel room is not great.. On our first night we had no hot water, but the hotel staff fixed that problem very quickly. However the hotel staff are courteous and provided a good service.If you are in Delhi for a couple of days and want to be in a good location to the attraction, this hotel will be fine. Jun 4 2009 Excellent service I've stayed at this hotel a number of times so far - always for business - and the one thing that stands out is the customer service, and he staff's desire to please.The hotel is small, but very well kept, and clean. The wireless internet used to be problem, but they have fixed it. The food in Zaffran is excellent... the breakfast is to order, and always prepared very well. They cater to a lot of foreign tourists.The location of the hotel is superb. Right above the Metro station which makes traveling around Delhi a breeze. Its also in the heart of Connaught Place (CP) with plenty of options in shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and great to walk around in the evenings when traffic is a lighter.I've always had a pleasant experience at the hotel, and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean, safe, and good place to stay. It is a little pricey, and I think would be better valued at about $25-30 below its current rates. May 20 2009 take your chances We stayed here on two separate occassions. We landed in Delhi and stayed the night before leaving elsewhere. Our first night was awesome. The room was small, but adequate. It was nicely decorated and clean. No complaints. When we returned a few days later it was a different story. Our room was even smaller than the first night. We were given dirty towels and bed sheets. The walls were scuffed and dirty. The thermostat control was so filthy it was black. When we complained, the staff apologized,but that was about it. It was hard to believe this was the same hotel.It wasn't cheap either. We paid $183.00 Cdn through Expedia, not good value for the money. We paid for a hotel transfer and didn't get one, nor did we get a refund. The outside of the hotel looks very rough, but once inside it is nicely decorated. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Zaffron offers great value for the money. The food and service was one of the best we had in India. Apr 30 2009 A good staritng point The service here was excellent, particularly in the restaurant. The rooms are very modern and the bathroom had a good shower. Rooms are a bit small with no view, but are kept very clean, with clean linen every day. Complimentary fruit, water and snacks are provided It was relatively expensive compared to the rest of India, but worth it for Delhi. Breakfast is included with the rate and has a good choice and a decent buffet. The food in the restaurant was one of the best Indian restaurants we visited and very good value Apr 29 2009 Good hotel conveniently located on Connaught Place Well located on Connaught Place and for getting a tuk tuk to the varying sites of Delhi. The hotel is better than an 'average 3*' rating but not good enough for a ' very good 4*' rating. The service was good and the rooms are clean, if a little on the small side. However, if you are only in Delhi for a day and a night (which we were) then it does exactly what you want. The restaurant (attached to the hotel) called Zaffran was very good. Apr 23 2009 Excellent and well priced hotel right in the thick of it! This was the third hotel we stayed in during our to-ing and fro-ing to Delhi. It was the cheapest (£98 per room per night inc breakfast), the nicest and the best placed hotel of the lot!The staff were great and very helpful. The room was lovely, clean and well equipped. Best of all was the restaurant and the central position. The breakfast was excellent and we ate at the restaurant too on our last night in India, which was reasonably priced and one of the best meals we had during our trip. The location couldn't be better - walk out of the door and you're right in the middle of the intensity that is Connaught place! But inside it's calm and a haven. If you've only got a few nights in Delhi - stay here. Apr 20 2009 Perfect Boutique Hotel If you are lookin for a hotel in Delhi which is centrally located, affordable, convinient then Palace Heights is the place to stay. The hotel is located on the inner circle of connaught place and is on the second floor. The approach kind of looks deceptive but once you enter the premises i bet you are heading for a good experience. Its a small property having 15-18 rooms only. There is a restaurant called Zafran which serves great Indian food and is also a popular among the locals. Complimentry morning breakfast is served here too. Being a small property you can be assured of personalised service. The staff right from the doorman at the entrance to the hotel manager are friendly and ever welcoming. The rooms are small but cant expect anything grand at that price (rs.6000 - 7000) in that part of the city. The room decor is modern and the bathrooms are done up well too. Its a great place for tourists who are lookin out for affordable accomodation, central location, not looking for aminities just wanting to sleep the night in good rooms eat good breakfat and get out to spend the day. Applies for business travellers as well. Apr 19 2009 An individual hotel with personal service We stayed for two nights at the palace heights and would definately recommend it. The room we stayed in was clean and with all the amenities you would expect, if a little small. The location is great for getting a feel for Dehli although I would warn you not to stray too far off the beaten track but this goes for everywhere in Dehli. The restaurant is excellent at a reasonable price. I know we could have eaten cheaper but for under ten pounds for more than the two of us could eat seemed a good deal to us especially as it was so good. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would go back again, in fact we did go back to the restaurant on our last night in India having unfortunately booked another hotel which wasn't nearly as good. Apr 18 2009 Great in all respects The well located Hotel Palace Heights is a Delhi oasis . The rooms are exceptionally clean and well thought out . They are well deocrated and all the things that you would expect from a good hotel have been considered such as good room service , wireless and various complimentary touches . The staff are exceptional and the service was excellent and attentive in all respects .The restaurant is also great and serves fanatastic food from North India , once again the service was great and the restaurant manager was particularly helpful in recommending dishes .Highly recommended Apr 10 2009 Fantastic hotel in a central location The hotel is small but great, in a very central location in Delhi. The rooms were fantastic, I can't fault anything wrong with the rooms. The hotel restaurant was also great - I highly recommend it. Apr 6 2009 Don't judge a book by it's cover Arriving at Connaught Place, Delhi is an experience in itself. Oh my goodness, the driving is like nothing on earth I have ever seen before. Cars, people, bicycles, tuk-tuks and anything goes.From outside the hotel looks small and unassuming but once inside its cool air-conditioned loveliness all your travel stresses disappear. The Reception staff are very helpful and their english is excellent. We had arrived in India with only 3 of our 21 nights with a hotel booking, the hotel staff recommended a travel agent - Perfect Holidays, and a very helpful man, Javid organised the next 8 nights for us including internal flights, accommodation and a driver.The room was a little on the small side but very clean as was the bathroom with all the usual trimmings - extra loo roll, shower cap etc.The hotel is in a great location, smack bang in the middle of the shopping area and close to the underground Palika market. Breakfast in the Restaurant was lovely - choice of indian, continental or english. This was one of the better hotels we stayed in on our trip. Mar 30 2009 Fab fab fab fab!!! This was my second stay at palace heights, and it was just as great as the first one! This is definitely one hotel I would recommend people stay at, everytime you visit delhi. They have an excellent restaurant attached, and althou living in the UAE gives you access to great indian food, this is truly authentic. Their room service is even more fab, with meals reaching in 10mins! The rooms althou small are immaculately maintained and any troubles you may have are dealt with immediately. The staff, right from their manager to the various service attendants are so polite, its ridiculous. I have stayed at various hotels all over India and none have been this wonderful an experience. Literally, one can make no complaints. Its the perfect Boutique hotel. Only thing missing is possibly a spa, just to wrap the deal!Will definitely keep staying at Palace heights, everytime I do visit Delhi. Mar 21 2009 Highly recommended - comfortable rooms with modern flair good food! Situated on Connaucht Place. Spacious bedroom and bathroom. Furnishings all-round elegant and in very good condition. Amenities: Airconditioning functioned well, safe, upon arrival complementary fruit basket (1 apple, 1 orange, 2 bananas, 2 chocolate biscuits) and daily two large bottles of water, facilities to make tea or coffee, free daily newspaper. We like Indian food as authentic as possible, i.e. spicy and hot. Hotel Restaurant Zaffran satisfied both criteria. In fact, the food was absolutely delicious, delicately spiced, and not too hot. Two main dishes plus two portions of Naan bread and a bottle of water average cost between 775 and 900 Rupee. Although the breakfast buffet was rather simple, the food was good. The usual cereals, two kinds of fruit, bread, butter, jam and honey. Orders for eggs, bacon/sausages/ham, toast, coffee or tee are taken by a waiter. The coffee was absolutely fantastic! Each cup prepared separately with freshly ground coffee beans. The hotel &amp; restaurant staff was competent, very friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Mar 15 2009 Great service location breakfast and value for money! We only booked a day room at the Palace Heights at the end of our trip after arriving by sleeper train at 9:15 am and before flying home that night, but we would have no hesitation in using it for our entire stay in Delhi on our next visit. We had a smooth and speedy check-in, and being ravenous, as we had not eaten on the train that morning, went straight into breakfast which was delicious, especially the pancakes and capuccino! Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, with a kettle and tea/coffee, the shower gave ample hot water and there were lovely toiletries. The hotel is on the first floor (there is a lift) which means the rooms are quiet, and its location on Connaught Square is excellent - we loved the great bookshop 2 blocks away. Best of all, however is the service: from the doorman downstairs who loaded our luggage into the lift and whisked us up to reception, to the smiling receptionist and waiters in the restaurant - nothing was too much trouble, and every member of staff was eager to please. I can highly recommend the Palace Heights as great value for money. Feb 27 2009 The Best Ever ! Will be back for more I'm so glad that I had chance to stay in Palace Heights.I was traveling alone to Delhi for architecture conference. I'm a woman and Delhi's first timer.I did my 'research' on tripadvisor and decided to choose 3 hotels for my stays: Ginger Hotel, Hans Hotel and Palace Heights.I had a good hunch with Palace Heights, since my first email conversation with their general manager, Mr. Joseph. He responded to my email and made me sure that my reservation is secured. Palace Heights is such a high demand hotel among travelers and I can see why during my stay.I loved the building and its settings. Palace Heights is an example of successful adaptive re-used building. The location is just perfect, in the center of CP and just a minute walk to fabIndia.I loved the hotel room - minimalist, simple and very clean. I loved the window which facing to CP and you can witness the bustling busy experience downstairs. And the goof thing is the room is very quite - you can't hear anything from outside.But the thing I loved more is the superb service and warm greetings ! From receptionist to restaurant, from housekeeper to general manager! They are doing their best to help me and make sure my stay is incredible. And they did.I'm really impressed when I asked their help whether I can print my essays for my presentation at the conference. They don't have business center. So what they did was, they take me to hotel's main office, which located couple blocks from the hotel. And they insist to take me by hotel's car. After I print everything, the car drove me back to hotel.The porter always accompanied me when I want to take a tuk tuk and made sure that the driver know where I want to go and bargain the price for me. And for the bonus - they have a free wifi !I'm so blessed with all kindness I accepted during my stay and I will be back for more Palace heights experience. Feb 10 2009 High Standards at a reasonable price Arrived from London, our pick up (arranged through the hotel) was waiting for us. The hotel is located in a good part of New Delhi, a short walk from shops and parks and the Metro is very close by. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly, rooms are very clean and modern. The restaurant is excellent. The only negative points were: 1. We specifically booked twin beds (travelling with my daughter) and when we arrived this was not available. The first night they found us another room, on the second (a week later) they provided a Collapsible bed but this was quite uncomfortable. Unfortunately the same problem occurred wherever we stayed during the trip. 2. The second minor problem was the surging shower with fluctuating water temperature (not extreme so merely annoying). Jan 31 2009 A great respite from the bustle of New Delhi The location is fantastic, the Palace Heights give you an oasis of calm right in the middle of Connaught Place.The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, with good recommendations for restaurants in the area, since no matter how the the hotel restaurant is (and it it good) -- you can't eat there every night.The included fruits, water and breakfast help you get your day off to a good start easily with no hassle.I had also arranged airport pickup through the hotel and everything went very smoothly: driver was there on time, very professional etc.. Jan 5 2009 A Haven of Peace My husband and I stayed at the Palace Heights at the start of our Indian holiday in November. We had arranged an airport pick up with them which sadly wasn't there when we landed. We called the hotel who immediately got a driver to us so we were not really delayed. On arrival (given that this was 6 in the morning) they got us a welcome drink and told us our room would be ready in 20 minutes. This was a real bonus as it meant we could have a sleep before hitting Delhi.Throughout our stay the staff were really helpful. Changing money for smaller notes, booking cars etc.Each day we had complimentary water and fresh fruit. The hotel was a real haven away from the bustle of Connaught Place and the food in the Zaffran restaurant was really good and service was also excellent. Dec 31 2008 Good location tidy and professional staff We stayed at the hotel various nights in December 2008 and used the hotel as our hub for a number of trips throughout India.The hotel has been renovated recently and now offers business-style, clean and tidy rooms with spacious beds and a fine bathroom (the best one we had during our trip, always enjoyed coming back there ...).From the hotel, you have easy acces to various shops (incl. Western shops with sometimes attractive proces) at Connaught Place, restuarants included. From the hotel its only a few meters to the new subway, that brings you e.g. directly to the railway stations for hardly any money. We used it several times and always enjoyed the ride.The hotel staff is professional and also takes take of the guest's needs. We used both airport pick-ups and drop-offs.The restaurant at the hotel offers very good food, the elevated prices (compared to other options outside the hotel) are worth it and the staff is great and friendly.There might be cheaper place to stay in Delhi, but Palace Heights benefits from its central location, professional staff and proper rooms. We'd go back there if we return to Delhi. Dec 3 2008 Fantastic! Stayed at the hotel for a business trip, the rooms were lovely and the staff extremely helpful. Will definitely be staying there for my next trip to Delhi! Highly recommended. Dec 2 2008 Great Stay We stayed here for two nights after arriving in Delhi from the US. We went ahead and arranged for transport to the hotel (RS. 800) to avoid having to deal with prepaid taxis upon arrival. The hotel is about 45 minutes away from the airport. Check-in was smooth and though our room was a bit small, it was very comfortable. We were provided with complementary fruit and bottled water daily. I especially appreciated how quiet it got at night. We had a minor issue with the hot water but it was rectified very quickly. Breakfast in the hotel was good and very convenient. We had dinner at Bukhara at the Maurya. The food was fabulous!The hotel arranged for a day tour of Delhi using their car and also for early morning transport to the Delhi railway station. Although we found the tariff to be a little overpriced, we would definitely stay here again for the amenities and the convenience. Dec 1 2008 An affordable gem Recently, I was looking for a centrally located, hotel in Delhi, which was not $300/ night! Happened to go through the reviews on your website and came across Hotel Palace Heights in Connuaght Place that seemed to fit in my budget, and scheme of things – both in terms of location and just the general feel. I was able to easily make my bookings through emails that were promptly answered and all doubts were clarified. From the moment I entered to the time I checked out (4 days), I knew I had made the right choice and had found really good hotel in Delhi. A place that I would like to come back to and recommend to others. The rooms were very clean and done in a very fashionable style, but most importantly comfortable to stay in. Some hotels take fashion to an extreme and make it uncomfortable But this place seems to have struck the right balance. The in-house restaurant was an absolute treat. Seems to be a very popular choice as there was a long waiting even on weekdays. The hotel was very courteous to keep tables for hotel guests on hold and never made us wait for a table. Plus a special discount for hotel guests in the restaurant. Also the room service was very efficient and even at 3 am in the morning the food was served with a smile. The Internet was truly, wireless and truly unlimited with no snags or hidden costs. In India, many a places advertise about their wireless but it really is pathetic. Initially, I had some technical difficulty getting on to their wireless on my MAC, but the front office guy came and solved everything within no time. A suggestion to the hotel: it really is a nice place, though they do have a long list of wines, cocktails and all kinds of alcohols being served; available in the rooms and in the restaurant. A small watering hole that one can go to after a long day of work in the city will go a long way in making me feel even more at home. Wink wink. Nov 1 2008 Definately a good place to stay Service is the best After reading the revieiws, we booked the hotel. I was hoping for a clean place, and they defnately met that requirement. The room we had was a bit small as others had pointed out, but it was clean, well equipped, comfortable, and right in the middle of the city, close to most everything.The real standout was the service at the hotel. They carried our bags, arranged for transportation, had excellent room service, and met any extra request we had. One of our travelers in the groups was sick. They went out and got her medication we requested, made special meals for her, and kept an eye on her when we went out exploring the city. I couldn't have asked for anything more for my little sister when she was sick.Definately eat in the hotel's restaurant. It is great food. I was really worried when we arrived, because from the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall and I would never have booked it, but it is completely different from the inside. Don't let the outside picture worry you.Because it is located in the heart of the city (Connaught Place), it is a bit expensive, but you are paying for the location. It is definately cheaper than other hotels around the area when we were looking. Oct 4 2008 Great choice in this price range. The Palace Heights is probably one of the best hotels in Delhi in the moderate price range. The location, rooms, service are great and the restaurant is fantastic. The staff were especially helpful and welcoming. Highly recommended. Sep 22 2008 It's ok - but come for the food Good points:- No noise from street- Central location- Cheap / good value- Good facilities in room (plasma TV, large bathroom, minibar)- EXCELLENT restaurant with 24 hour room service. Come here like the locals to eat fantastic North Indian food- Very reliable airport transfers, cars were right on time- Helpful staff who rectified issues immediately (see below)Bad points: - Noise from other people's rooms, slamming doors, voices in the corridor etc- Bed sheets and towels were dirty when I arrived - but this was quickly rectified - Surfaces also dirty - reception didn't apologise but immediately sent a cleaner - Expensive minibar - but what do you expect! - The sink drain was very smelly and some flies congregated around itIt's a good choice but expect some noise from other guests, and question the reception if you don't feel things are that clean. Sep 10 2008 Friendly I've booked this hotel via Desiya an Indian website and got a good price. I was a bit concerned as I was going over with my small fella and the wife. It has been a wonderful experience - breakfast was brilliant as they had continental as well as Indian Poori Bhaji which was delicious! As my wife was indisposed for 3 days they made hot chapatis to take into the room and my son enjoyed his cereals. I had my Beer &amp; dinner all days at the hotel and the service was attentive - they served good mughalai dishes! My son had Rice &amp; Dal Makhni all the time which he call Brown Sauce!! As mentioned already the TV is good as all rooms had independent SKY receivers for entertainment. This is a very well located hotel for shopping trips to Pallika Bazaar and short distance away from Ghafaar market, thoroughly enjoyed the walking until I got dehydrated?!!! Very clean place which has recently been redecorated - recommended. Sep 3 2008 Clean Modern cozy central While travelling to India I booked through the internet this hotel.There were not many pictures and not much information but reviews seemed to be good enough so I took the risk. It was well worth it. This small hotel in the centre of New Delhi, is not only close to everything but may be the the best choice for an affordable yet clean and beautiful stay. It was recently renovated and although the rooms are small, it has good service, it is clean and quiet (unlike the rest of India). has aircondition (but no heating.. even though the temperature on January is quite low.). I definitely reccomend it as a safe, cheap, and clean choice. Sep 2 2008 Fantastic! A true gem. Hotel Palace Heights is a superb boutique hotel in the heart of Delhi. Exceptional service and friendly staff had us staying at this quiet hotel twice this summer. Spotless rooms and central location, the hotel's Saffron Restaurant is also a treat.Staying there was truly heaven. Our thanks to the wonderful staff who made our stay in Delhi memorable. Aug 12 2008 Clean great staff - a little gem While a lot less ostentatious and pricey than the big international hotels in ND, this little place really deserves its high rating.Stayed here for a few days arriving in India, and then again one night before shipping back to Europe. The staff is extraordinarily friendly, and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and have good modern amenities (plasma TV every room with international news channels for those of us that still like to stay in touch). While located smack in the middle of Connaught Place with plenty of restaurants around, the hotel restaurant is also worth a visit. Well priced and delicate food, looked after and managed by a very helpful manager and really nice staff.The only drawback is the lack of pool / SPA. For that, you have to go to the bigger hotels in the outskirts of town (well, so so) so its up to you if you want to make that trade off. All in all, a place we can warmly recommend! Jul 10 2008 Clean safe and comfortable hotel in Dehli! Arrived in New Delhi and our transfer was waiting, as promised. Check-in was easy and the staff were great. The room was modern, but small and the view was less than spectacular. If you plan to be in Delhi for a short stay and will be on the go most of the time, this place is great. If you are planning to spend nights in, it could feel a bit tight. That said, everything else was amazing. The room itself is has a flat screen TV, snacks of fruit and bottled water at no extra charge. Room service is great and it's offered 24 hours a day. The linens were very nice and very clean. The pillows were lovely. The bathroom had beautiful floor to ceiling marble, the shower was large and there was a good supply of hot water. I think the power may have been an issue once, but not bad. The towels were clean and all the toiletries offered were nice. The complimentary breakfast was huge! For the low price this is a winner, clean, great service and a central location make this hotel hard to beat! Jun 16 2008 comfortable stay I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; had both the dinners here. The hotel is a contemporary one with all the style, elegance &amp; modern amenities. The food in the restaurant- Zaffran was really blessings to the tastebuds. Jun 8 2008 Stay away for the love of God We just completed a 5 days stay at the hotel. two days prior to our arrival we asked for airport pickup. That didn't happen, and not much of an apology was provided.We arrive at the hotel. and it takes them 30 minutes to check us in, even though we are the only ones there. Funny thing about that, the hotel claim to have 40 rooms, actually they only have 15. and the lies continue. They also claim to have free internet access. what they mean is, if you have a good internet subscription for your phone, it will also work within their hotel. They still tried to convince me they actually did have a wireless network, I said show me, then they said, they don't know how, and they can't call anyone.The room is so small, you feel clostrophobic. And the aircondition only has icy cold or really hot. The &quot;fancy&quot; flatscreen is the oldest LCD samsung available, and the picture quality is awful. All the furniture is cheap plastic.Someone below has mentioned they give complementary fruits, water and cookies. but don't eat the cookies, otherwise, you don't get any new ones, and if you don't eat the fruit, they just leave it. see the tasty picture of the moldy fruit. and even the bottled water is expired. are you kidding me.The building, is a completely delapidated building, doesn't matchwebsite pictures.the &quot;wonderful restaurant and breakfast&quot; that someone mentioned. There are two fruits cut last night, some cereal, and then you can order and omelet or pancakes. Don't do the last, it gave us a little brown present for two days - if you know what I mean.Location: connaught place is really dirty, shopping is very good, but you just feel disgusted with the dirt and flies. If you are Indian, no problem, but if you are white, there are 1000 conmen ready to approach you in a very aggresive way. Our Indian friend also advised us not to go outside after 7. yes, I said 7.Now to the masterpiece. The reception. They are 20 years old, and have the combined intelligence of a 10 year old. They cannot answer any questions, like airport question, shopping question, internet question, etc etc. When we were checking out, the boy spent 30 minutes counting the minibar, and when we went back to the room, he actually checked one more time before we could leave, just to make sure we didn't take a 40 Rupee cola. keep in mind we just spent 32500 rupees for the room.All in All, do yourself a big favour. Do not budget travel in Delhi. We have been to a few hotels in India, and this one takes the price. WOW. Apr 25 2008 fine for a short stay Arrived at this hotel located on the second floor of a period building overlooking Connaught Place just before midnight and the staff were expecting us. The room is clean, functional and 'modern', with mock wooden floors and minimalist furniture, decorations and bathroom. Linen was spotless and towels plentiful, and there were chocolate biscuits for an evening snack along with complimentary bottled water. But the room felt small, and if there was any more than one of you it would not be somewhere you could relax at the end of a long day's sightseeing or really get comfortable if you just wanted a 'day off'. There’s something a bit clinical and cold about the décor. We stayed there in transit (arrived midnight, departed 0700 the next morning) and it was fine, as it would be if you were on business and in meetings all day. Breakfast was included in the room rate and you can have it either in the restaurant or delivered to your room (no extra charge). The breakfast was fine without being memorable. The hotel gets an 'above average' rating because it was clean, the staff helpful, and the cost spot-on. Apr 21 2008 very nice hotel We stayed 4 nights in this nice hotel very welll located, clean , staff is very nice and helpfull at the reception and in the hotel restaurant The Saffran In a previous review one person mention that the only bad thing he could say was that the towel were old, well they replace it for new one The beds are very confortable . They give you every day 2 bottles of water and fruits , newspaper in the morning and on arrival they serve you juice. We tried near the hotel the Zen restaurant which was very good , it is about 5 minutes by walk from the hotel on your right side when you get out of the hotel. Do not be surprise but when you arrive the building do not announce what is inside the hotel is on the seconf floor of an old buiding, the hotel was renovated 1 year ago. It is not expensive for New Delhi do not hesitate to book . Apr 17 2008 Great Just great. Very well located in Connaught Place, great rooms, nice furnished and modern decoration, flat screen tv, nice bathrooms, nice restaurant, very friendly staff, affordable... Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find. I'll be back. Apr 15 2008 Very good hotel I went to India on April the 3rd and stay at Palace Heights for 2 days after going to Jaipur, and stayed there in the last night in India on April the 10th. This is a very nice hotel, good rooms, not very large but OK, with LCD TV and they offer each day mineral water and a fruit basket. The bathroom was very good too.The dinner and breakfast room was nice, and the staff very friendly. And I must say this is an hotel in the center of Delhi, near the Indian and international shops. I recommend this hotel. Apr 10 2008 Cute little hotel Very small room. The staff were friendly and helpful . It's very good for the price and location and running around in Delhi.The restaraunt, Zaffron, is the best thing about this hotel. The menu is great and the prices are about $15 per meal.I recommend this hotel when you are in Delhi. Apr 8 2008 Refreshingly good...a must stay on your visit to Delhi Location: at the heart of the city. you can never ask for a better location. This is considered to be the finest location in New Delhi.Rooms, Staff, Service, Reception: ExcellentBreakfast: Complimentry and excellent choice of menu.Very good decor and so peaceful. Apr 4 2008 A Hidden Gem Excellent management &amp; staff:-This place has an unassuming front and is fairly new. Small with 14 rooms, but excellently managed. Well staffed and no pressure to tip whatsoever. Your every wish is their command and they make you feel special. Asked for hair dryer, iron, extra towels etc. and all supplied within minutes. Forgot to switch off the &quot;do not disturb sign&quot; outside the door on one occasion. Hence found rooms not made on return in evening. Called reception. No problem. Room made up in 10 minutes. Seldom does one see such service.No queues for check-in or check out as there are only 14 rooms.24 hour room service @ no extra charge. Safe deposit &amp; Minibar Good air con / heating .Thick fabric window blinds keep the blazing sunlight out and let you have a late morning sleep.Plasma TV on wallComfortable super king size bed with nice pillowsLarge interior illuminated wardrobe with plenty of space. 2 full length dressing mirrors on wall .Complimentary breakfast - cereal, fruit juice,egg, bacon, sausage, toast, Indian poori with potato masala. Egg served many ways. Try the masala omlette which is like a spanish omlette &amp; is lovely. Coffee expresso, cappucino or simply black.Free newspaper and a call for breakfast before they close at 10.30am (in case you forget)!Toilet:Extremely clean &amp; shiny toilet with a brilliant shower. Plenty of hot water. Shampoo, body lotion and soaps all provided. This the only hotel toilet I have ever seen where the mirrors do not get misted after a shower, thanks to the excellent ventilator fan, which also removes any odours instantly. Plenty of thick clean towels.Airport pick up by hotel worked well.Restaurant:Checked in at 12pm after a late flight and although it was closing time for the attached Zaffiran restaurant, they still let me order from the menu! Their food is very good . Tandoori chicken cooked to perfection. Also try their lamb dish (cant remember the name) which is a whole leg of lamb prepared with exquisite spices. The hyderabadi mutton biriyani is also recommended. Plenty of locals eat here. For $25 2 people can have a three course meal! Nice decor and ambience as well.And all this for GBP $150 per night in Connaught place. What more can you ask for? Interestingly, when I tried to book rooms via trip advisor, all the booking agents said &quot;room not available&quot; and offered rooms at other places, but when I emailed the hotel directly, they had vacancies!On the other hand if you want window views and gardens, look elsewhere, but for the price, this place cant be beaten.Certainly recommended and will stay here again.Good management always counts! Apr 3 2008 Did not honor reservation agreement I shared a room with two friends. The manager confirmed via email that we would have the room for six nights before we paid our deposit. On arrival they told us we will only have the room for three nights. Different people manning the hotel reception gave conflicting reasons why this is so. However their reasons were not convincing as from the booking screen on their computer we noticed that two other guest were booked into our reservation. Furthermore the manager that agreed on our six night reservation is nowhere to be found even by his own staff. They tried to move us to another related hotel that is out of the city center which we refuse to due to their prior breech of trust. We were in Delhi for a conference and had to skip part of it to look for another hotel. This was extremely disruptive. The impression I have is the hotel tries to get you there before moving you to a less popular co-owned hotel due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot;. I recommend not using this hotel for important business since they do not honor their reservation agreements unless you do not mind finding another hotel at the last minute. Apart from this, the rooms are well furnished as expected for the price that they charge, and service is prompt. Mar 30 2008 Great Choice for One Night Overall, this was a fine place to stay for one night; however, no one met us on arrival at IGIA to take us to the hotel, even though we had previously booked the transfer and re-confirmed prior to arrival. Not the best way to start off our stay. The hotel claims someone was there, and we just didn't see him. We waited for 45 minutes, then decided that no one was coming. There were TONS of drivers with signs waiting, just not for us. We took a pre-paid taxi, which was easy and reasonable, but taxi drivers don't seem to know where this hotel is. If they can get you to Connaught Place (which they DO know), just stop someone on the street and ask for the hotel, telling them that it's located behind the Odeon Cinema (there is more than one cinema in Connaught, though). The hotel is very small and unassuming, somewhat difficult to spot from the street (it's on the second/upper floor above storefronts). There is an entry door on the ground level, which was well-lit and staffed by a security guard and two other employees (e.g., bellman and restaurant maitre 'd, I think). There is a lift to the second floor. The lobby area is tiny (just the front desk and two chairs), off which is the Zaffron restaurant (attractive, well-staffed, but we only had drinks so I can't comment on the food). Our room was tiny as well, just enough room to walk around the perimeter of the bed. The bathroom was a decent size, with standing shower and Western toilet. Some basic toiletries were provided. Hairdryer upon request. The room was very modern and pleasant-looking, with a comfy bed, suede throw pillows, and flat-screen TV. Complimentary wi-fi access in the rooms worked perfectly. Two bottles of complimentary water were provided, along with chocolates and a fruit plate (we did not get to sample the included breakfast due to an early departure), welcome drinks upon arrival. The hotel was able to change money for us; there was no ATM machine visible nearby. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again; it's a great value (approximately $150 USD for a double room) once you find the location. Mar 9 2008 Excellent hotel stayed 1 night, extremely helpful staff, clean modern room, good restaurant, a sanctuary in the middle of delhi, very near excellent metro system stationi have only positives to say about this hotel Feb 21 2008 Smashing hotel !!! Clean tidy and central!! 4 star !!! This hotel is lovely. its clean tidy and very well positioned. it bang in the heart of everything. I would rate it as 4 star !!!The staff are friendly and alway willing to help you.There is also a lovey restaurante in the hotel.The rooms are fitted with a plasma screen tv and mini bar.There is also a railway near by. we went to agra for the day to see the taj mahal. its 2 hours on the express train or 4 hours on the normal locals train. we went on the express train to agra and returned on the locals train just for the experience. i would reccomend this. Feb 16 2008 good central hotel This is a really good hotel to arrive to in delhiIts in a central location and the staff were very nice even though there were too many knocks on the door for one thing or anotherIt was clean and comfortable but the towels were old and grey!When i started looking for a hotel in delhi it was really difficult to find one that wasn't either really expensive or that looked dirtyThis was neither even though it was more expensive than any other hotels i stayed in in india but it was definitely worth it Jan 27 2008 Wonderful Boutique Hotel The Hotel Palace Heights is certaintly excellent value for a stay in central Delhi.The service overall is outstanding. Full of nice touches - complimentary fruit bowl &amp; chocolates on arrival - the best hotel soaps &amp; lotions I have ever used - and very good breakfast with courteous &amp; professional staff. The rooms *are* small (as is the hotel - no large foyer or bars you enter via lift) so I would not book for an extended stay - but they are as modern and stylish as you will find anywhere, for a weekend or overnight you couldn't ask for more. I booked direct via email - and though I had change my original booking to 1 night (from 2) in email this was not acknowledged - so ensure you are clear from the outset. But I was not penalised so all went well. I'm in debt to the fellow reviewers on this website - I would not have found or chosen it without your help - so I am glad to add my voice to chorus of approval - my only regret is not staying in Delhi for longer ! Jan 6 2008 Pleasantly surprised When I first started searching the net for a Delhi hotel I was horrified at the cost of accommodation. We definitely wanted to stay in or close to Connaught Place because it is so central and position is very important . I realised I would have to pay a bit more than usual but searched for medium hotels. The Palace Heights looked ok and the photos on the hotel website were good. It said that the hotel had recently been re-furbished. I realise now that this refurbishment is in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Took the plunge and booked. My husband and I were travellling with another couple and none of us were strangers to India, so we were prepared for disappointment. Arrived at the airport and took a pre-paid taxi. Remember to have the printed full address on hand to show the driver. Connaught Place is divided into sections and it's important for the driver to have the full address. We arrived and took the lift to reception. Looked allright, clean and modern. Yes, they were expecting us (relief) and we were shown to our rooms. Airconditioned, modern and clean with flat screen television on the wall. The bathroom was compact, marble and clean. There was no view from the window but yes, the hotel passed our test. We ate at the restaurant and it was excellent. It was packed with locals which is always a huge recommendation. We stayed three nights and had no complaints. Then we left our heavy luggage there while we travelled in Rajasthan for a week. We returned for a final night, luggage was safe and sound, restaurant still great, the staff always obliging. Breakfast was served in the restaurant and was ordered from the menu - nothing flash but certainly good. This is a good hotel and certainly fits the bill for those not wanting to pay 5 star Delhi prices but wanting pleasant surroundings, cleanliness and a safe place to rest and of course position. Jan 4 2008 Great Hotel in the heart of New Delhi Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi is a great hotel. We stayed there on two seperate occasions during our trip to India and were pleased with both experiences. The hotel has been renovated relatively recently. The rooms are very modern and sleek, and most importantly, clean. The room we got on our first night in Delhi was small, but comfortable. The bathroom was clean and new, and the water hot. On our second time around, the room was bigger, which was nice, and equally clean and comfortable. It seems in Delhi that there are few options in the mid-range budget - everything is either ridiculously expensive and luxurious, or ridiculously cheap and disgusting. Hotel Palace Heights is right in the middle in terms of price and a wonderful bargain. It is in the heart of Connaught Place, too, which is an excellent location. The attached restaurant, Zaffran, is delicious. The food is safe and clean and really excellent. The service matches the food and decor. Like many places in India, the menu shows no liquor or beer, but it is available, which you will no doubt be glad to know after any amount of time in India. The staff were kind and helpful. Highly recommended. Jan 2 2008 Heaven after Hell! We stayed here for 1 night on the 13th December after 2 nights at the Hotel Ajanta (see seperate review).This hotel is in Connaught Place, section D. We booked with the hotel after turning up with our suitcase! I was trying to work out where to stay in the taxi from the Ajanta Hotel, it was that bad! This hotel worked out at approx £80 bed &amp; breakfast for the two of us.Room was small but had everything you needed, reminded me of a Marriott hotel back home. Bathroom was lovely, water was either very hot or cold but hey a small price considering where we had just come from! Plasma TV on wall, coffee &amp; tea facilities. They also gave us fresh orange juice and a fresh fruit platter - nice touch! Breakfast was freshly cooked. This area is very western with KFC, Macdonalds, TGI Friday's etc but we ate at a restaurant next door from our hotel called The Embassy - nice food but be aware as not only do they add a service charge they also add 'output VAT'. I would recommend anyone to stay here but as it's a little bit expensive it would probably be ok for the 1 night. Dec 1 2007 A pleasant place to stay in New Delhi My girlfriend and I stayed one night at Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi on 27/11/07. Having spent most of our holiday in India (Rajasthan) in budget accommodation, we decided to spend a bit more to just chill out for our last night in India.Our double room cost 5500Rs + 12.5% tax including breakfast. The room was excellent - comfortable, extremely clean, a nice ambience (the staff said the hotel had been refurbished around February this year). There were some nice touches like complimentary welcoming drinks (apple juice) and later a fruit platter during our stay. Service at the hotel was reasonable without being fabulous. Reliable hot water but in our room it was very difficult to find a comfortable temperature (ie. temp was either very hot or cold).Because we didn't really spend much of our holiday in similar accommodation, I am unsure whether this price is reasonable or comparable to other hotels in New Delhi. The only thing I could compare it to is Hotel Jukaso Inn (Connaught Place), recommended by Lonely Planet, which we booked online in a last minute rush for our first night in India, for which we foolishly paid 3850Rs + tax for a double room - it was terrible (dirty, small)... completely different to Hotel Palace Heights, which is literally a few doors away. Nov 27 2007 Great hotel great location Hotel Palace Heights is a great hotel in a great situation in Delhi.The staff were lovely and the level of service was amazing. The room was small but very nicely furnished although there were no views. The bed was very comfy.We ate lightly in their restaurant on our last night in India the food was good and I felt that we should have taken advantage of this earlier in our stay.Although our room was small, I felt that the Hotel Palace Heights is aspiring to great things. Nov 23 2007 Lovely small hotel This is a very small and charming hotel situated very centrally in the buzz of Connaught Place, about 45 mins drive from the airport. It has been very recently refurbished to a high standard with modern and tasteful decor. The staff were very friendly, courteous and attentive throughout my 2 night stay. The room was not particularly large, but had a big bed, flat screen tv, and immaculate marble bathroom with large shower. There is no view to speak of, but that didn't bother me. The restaurant is also excellent, serving very tasty and good value Indian food in pleasant surroundings, with a good choice for breakfast (not buffet). I found it very difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in Delhi which looked any good, and did not want to stay in the big chain hotels. This hotel fitted the bill perfectly - I can thoroughly recommend it to anyone. Nov 23 2007 Excellent hotel Palace heights is an excellent hotel at a great location. Close to the metro from where you can explore the whole city. Rooms are clean and everything works. Very nice and helpful staff. Really a great place to stay for peoplpe who want a save haven in a crazy city !! Close to all the shops at Cannaugt place. Jun 27 2007 Excellent place to stay This Hotel is located in CP in Delhi. Simply VOW... I think its a boutique hotel.Its truely amazing. Room rent was around Rs 4500/= for single room and experience was fantastic.Room was very small but stylishly done. It had flat screen TVand the interiors were superb.Thumbs up and 5 stars to this hotel. Feb 24 2009 toll - aber...

I couldn't agree more with the second to last reviewer especially with regard to the moth ballsThe bathroom suite was black and the bath itself was peeling and a bit of a safety hazard. The toilet had one of those &quot;sanitized for you convenience&quot; labels on it which was a joke as it was not clean. The shower curtain was filthy. The rest of the room was adequate but I didn't feel it was all that clean.Breakfast was OK.With regards to the new wing mentioned by the previous reviewer, I don't think this is being marketed as part of the Mehar as it looks from the photos in a completely different league.I would chose not to stay here in the future. Nov 18 2009 Thumbs up I was fortunate to be the very first customer of a new hotel wing associated with the Mehar Castle Hotel (same owner and overlapping management), just starting to operate as the JP Bed &amp; Breakfast Hotel in mid-Nov 09 (web page yet to come). The location is just adjacent to the Mehar Castle, on a side street near Ghaffar Market of Amjal Khan Road, in Karol Bagh. I can only recommend this hotel, which is all new, with relatively generous, classy, ensuite rooms, tiled flooring and modern style furniture with latest appliances (a/c, TV, ceiling fan, fridge, safety lockers, etc…), neat bathrooms etc. It also features a small dining room for customer use and is a very quiet hotel away from street noise. I would rate the room comfort as 3.5-4 stars, with reasonable cost (Rs2,500-3,500 range inc. pick-up and breakfast). The down sides? No power point by the desk (eg. for computer), no outside windows (the price of a quiet room…) and small lobby space. Room decoration was also yet to come. The new hotel staff have been very helpful and efficient, being proud of inaugurating their small new 5 room hotel wing - the food: so far, so very good. So thumbs up from me ! Nov 3 2009 sets the bar low I'm not one to complain much, but as my first hotel in India, this really set the bar low, even though I wasn't expecting a lot. From the green slime covering the shower head, to the rot in the corners of the bathtub, to the mothballs scattered throughout the room, to the infernally noisy air conditioner...i don't know where to start. I'll start with the dead bugs i was picking out of my bed before i went to bed. And the noise that woke me up at 6am...it was daily street noise that felt like it was just on the other side of thin walls. Or maybe I'll start with the bed that felt like a plank of wood covered with a thin blanket? The cold shower is not something i would complain about since I didn't get it at 8 of the 9 hotels I stayed at. The area around the hotel is in the main shopping area of Karol Bagh. It's not the safest area to start out in, but you can get good bargains, and it's close to the metro. They offer free internet but it's really slow. The phone in the room is on a rotary dial system. On the bright side, the room was large, the hard bed turned out to be relatively comfortable, and room service was attentive, if not on the annoying side. Oct 22 2009 an excellent location for stay.. Hotel provides good hospitality..we were provided with a family room which had two double beds..which was perfect for my wife and my two children. Good service,good food.. Jan 24 2008 A fairly decent hotel My wife and I stayed in Room # 208 (Double Deluxe Room at INR 1690/night, as advertised on their web site).Location: within about 5 minutes' walk to Karol Bagh metro station. Plenty of street shops and vendors in the daytime.Quite a spacious room with sitting area, marble floors. Not spotlessly clean maybe, but quite decent. Hard mattresses, aircon working but wouldn't set to heating, though staff provided additional blankets on request. Still, as the draught was coming through the window we had to move our bed to the middle of the room every night and back every morning. Noise protection next to non-existent, so all door bangs and loud conversations in the corridor are heard very clearly, and so is the work in the street.No reading lights.Bathroom has definitely seen better days. There was hot water in the shower, though the pressure was barely adequate.Good staff. Excellent food – probably the best vegetable fried rice we had during our two-week trip.\", doc_id='f98b73de-162e-4558-ac31-7a0ee3b776da', embedding=None, doc_hash='51f1cff1e3f0c063fa9101294f1ad0482427242154bfb944d3b7c91ebab7c9d9', extra_info=None)], [Document(text=\"Everything awesome about it and its at a very low price Now this is what is called a great hotel at a great location with the best price. I stayed in this hotel for two days and had booked a &quot;standard room' meant for two people due to non availability of a single occupancy during booking time (i know its a waste of resource ;) ). The rooms are awesome! Very much clean. The corridors and the waiting lounge was very comfortable as well. The bathroom was good too but with no bathtub :( (It does matter to some !). It seems that the commode was meant for those people with a height &gt;6.5 feet as when you have to use it your feet cannot touch the floor. (What the heck?) The hotel has a restaurant named Comesum which is a chain of restaurants tied up with IRCTC which serves amazing food which being tasty was hygienic at the same time. The best part was its location. Its located right next to the New Delhi railway station(NDLS). So if you are coming by train you could even walk to the hotel. For local travel the metro station is again at a walking distance in fact closer than NDLS.As far as my stay was concerned I faced no problems except for they don't allow to take your car near the portico and you have to take your luggage and walk for some distance (not much). It could be bothersome when one has a lot of luggage but shouldn't be a deciding factor according to me given the security issues which the country faces.All in all my stay was good and I don't see any reason why I should give anything less than five in ratings. The negatives i mentioned shouldnt be a deciding factor as far as I believe. thanks for reading.... Best Effort by Ratan Tata for the middle class I found it extremely comfortable, very near to New Delhi Rly station travelling to the hotel by a cycle rickshow only. There is a metro entry just out side the hotel. A very good restaurant with a very reasonable price.If compared Room rent vs Cleanlilness , it will rank-1 in India. Normally the middle class cannot efford a lot of money in hotel, but desire cleanliness , a good restaurant etc, which is very well available in Zinger. It is also located extremely well convenient place. For Train Traveller, even better. Now onwards I even prefer to spend some money for this hotel to stay rather than choosing to free stay in our guest house in Noida.Thnak You Tata.Pankaj Kr Baruah best value for price Very warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. Good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. Best value for money Great quality for the price !! For train travelers it's PERFECTION! The quality for price cannot be beat in Delhi - for $40 you get clean rooms with satelite TV, AC, wireless (must pay but only $5 for 24 hours) and clean bathrooms - perfectly comfortable rooms. We stayed at a few other hotels for the same price range in Delhi and India and found them all to be MUCH worse. We also stayed at a few 5 star hotels which were (as expected) better but then again cost us $300 ... found Ginger to be the best bargain around.Also - we traveled around quite a bit by train using delhi as a our main hub and for this the LOCATION CANNOT BE BEAT! you are literally across the street from the train station (VERY helpful since some tickets can only be bought 2 hourse before the train leaves - if the train leaves at 5am you'll be grateful you only have to cross the street to get your 3am tickets!). Its also pretty close to Connaught Place (central Delhi) - around 2 km or INR 50 by tuck tuck (1 dollar).Good luck! mp Nov 26 2009 A Clean Hotel in Dirty Delhi We had three one-night stays here as we used Delhi as a transit point for various excursions during our month-long holiday.The hotel's location, just yards from the unimaginable filth and detritus and all-round excremental disgrace that is the New Delhi Sewerage Station, I mean - New Delhi Railway Station, is undoubtedly very convenient.The large hotel is easy to see even at night time and even with luggage you can just walk across the car park that lies between the station and the hotel.With all the building work going on for the Commonwealth Games (Surely flattening the city would be a better option? After all, it’s been rebuilt several times already over the centuries!) it might look daunting to get to but walking is far quicker and cheaper than any tuk-tuk or taxi - as we found to our cost the first time we tried to get to it.We had three different rooms during our three stays and, despite reports from other contributors, we found each room clean in all respects with all the facilities you'd expect in a business hotel (albeit a budget hotel) including copious hot water.The 24-hour coffee shop / restaurant was fine - lots of well-dressed locals were even coming in for takeaways.Staff were pleasant and helpful but they won't store luggage so you'll have to use the Left Luggage Office at the station. Lock your bags and padlock them to the bays - thieves had a damn good go at attempting to break into my friend's suitcase.The hotel's location is also it's biggest problem. The AC can inevitably bring in the smells of the station but this isn't the hotel's fault, nor is the damn awful noise from the trains coming through the station whose horns even the deaf can hear! What is it with Indians and noise, anyway? Perhaps ask the hotel if it has rooms facing away from the station. Otherwise take ear (and possibly, nose) plugs.Anyway - the plus points are of the hotel's making and the minus points (apart from not storing luggage for late leavers) isn't.I would happily try other Ginger hotels. The only reason I wouldn't go back to their Delhi hotel is because it would mean my going back to Delhi. A more hellish scenario I cannot imagine. Nov 26 2009 Terrible place - Avoid it!!! We booked Ginger Delhi for 2 days and left hotel with-in 2 hours of checking-in.My expectations were not great. I was looking for &quot;clean&quot; with no frills accommodation. But the room was far from being clean. There were bunch of long hairs on the floor. The hotel staff did not even check if the room was clean before handing over the room. When called housekeeping - they cleaned the room and only cleaned what we showed. After a second glance there were more bunch of hairs on the other side of the bed that the cleaner royally ignored.The walls had shoe prints. May be that previous guests wanted to make their footprints before they left. But at least I expected housekeeping to clean those marks from the wall. The quilt was almost black from one side and had couple of yellow spots all over. When called the housekeeping to change the covers - they came with two quilt covers - one was dirty and the other was less dirty. We asked him to change the less dirty one.The hotel staff cared not to clean anything as they have enough guests who keep coming on the name of Ginger - The Taj Group.The bathroom was clean - but there was no hot water. You can fall sick if you would take cold shower in winters. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom. We had to call thrice to get the toilet paper.There was a very small window in the room and the room was damn compact. I would have appreciated if they could at least make a bigger window. That would have given the room a bigger look. Stay there only when you have no option (or may be when you just have to spend few hours) and keep your expectations level for a usual Pahargunj hotel for which you would pay not more than Rs 1000.We moved the same day to Quality Inn, Gurgaon and paid hefty amount for that hotel as it was the last minute booking but at least our stay was damn comfortable there.When complained to Ginger customer service - we only got the regret letter for the inconvenience caused and there was no refund.I would strongly advise to avoid this hotel. This is not the place where you can spend two days. Nov 23 2009 Centrally Located Our journey to the Ginger Hotel didn't start too well. We booked a vehicle at the airport taxi counter. Once out of the airport our driver claimed he didn't know where the Ginger Hotel was located. We gave him a map but this didn't seem to help him. Fortunately, he could take us to the 'tourist office' who could phone Ginger for directions. The very 'helpful' man from the tourist office 'phoned' Ginger Hotel and was advised that they'd over-booked, but we could stay at their sister hotel for free! When we didn't believe this they passed the phone to us where the 'manager' apologised profusely and explained how the sister hotel was so much better. We still weren't convinced and realised it was a scam, and after we demanded that the taxi driver take us to the Ginger Hotel manager, we were given a ride to New Delhi railway station where we made our way on foot to the hotel. Of course we were immediately able to book in! When we were at the so-called 'tourist office' we saw other taxis pull up outside. The moral is that if you book a taxi from the airport then don't believe anything the driver, or anyone whose help he enlists, tells you about your hotel.The Ginger Hotel itself is quite bland but has clean rooms with comfortable beds and a TV for those who can't live without the box. They even have Wi-Fi (at a price) and there is a gym. Security is first class. There is a self-service cafeteria on site which provides exceptable food. The major downside was the booking process. We'd originally enquired about a room in August but it wasn't until 3 months later, 4 days before we were due to arrive, that the hotel was able to accept bookings. The only other problems were we were promised IT assistance when we experienced difficulties with the Wi-Fi connection, but this never arrived despite our phone calls, and there is no luggage storage facility at the hotel. Nov 22 2009 Best Place To Stay In Delhi Ginger hotels is a chain of hotels in India, mainly set up for business travellers, however if you are sick and tired of staying in terrible accomodation while travelling around India I would recommend paying a little extra and stay at a Ginger hotel. The Delhi hotel is right behind new delhi train station so centrally located for seeing the city. The rooms are very clean, flat screen tv, air con, clean sheets, clean showers, nice staff and tea/coffee in room. Rooms have a tiny frindge which does not get very cold but otherwise well worth paying a few extra poung to stay at. I would recommend booking ahead on their web site if possible to get the best price. Nov 16 2009 value for money was clean, and appeared safe. there was ample of room with clean bedding and hot water. additionally there is a good restaurant, business station and travel desk within the lodge. railway station is 5 min walk away. Nov 16 2009 What a place.. I say, friends, all those of u who want cleanliness, ginger new delhi can't be ur second choice... it was so calm, peaceful and so clean that at time i felt to leave the place never. So cheap and nearby to the station it was an amazing place to live in Nov 8 2009 Great place for a solo traveler This was a great place for a business trip. A spotlessly clean room, comfortable bed, bathroom and desk - plus wireless for an extra fee. I could also grab good, inexpensive food downstairs in the restaurant downstairs. Very key when I was pressed for time or needed to get something late at night and didn't feel safe heading out on my own after dark. This hotel has small rooms for 1 person which cost about half of a standard room, so perfect when traveling solo. Not great in terms of character but great if you just need a clean and safe place to sleep. If getting there by taxi, be sure to tell the driver it's by the Ajmeri Gate of the train station or they'll have a hard time finding it - and be sure to book at least a few weeks ahead of time. It books up, mostly by locals. Nov 6 2009 Well worth the money A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. The restaurant is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive. Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only 2 mins away by foot. Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside the hotel. There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great. All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after 9pm this is a highly recommended hotel. The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is . It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system. Oct 21 2009 An excellent choice This is an excellent choice and great value for the price. The room and bathroom were clean, A/C was great, flat screen TV with cable, hot water (though much better in morning than night), very cheap phone calls, internet in the lobby and very helpful staff. Restaurant is ok. If you check their website, it will show it fully booked for months to come. In reality, it seems to only take reservations in the short term. Excellent location right next to the New Delhi Station. although everyone will have a tough time finding it. Tell them to go to the New Delhi Station and then ask for the Rail Yatri Niwas. If you are walking, you have to walk through a dark, crowded industrial area to get to the hotel and solo women may not feel comfortable. Otherwise, highly recommended. Oct 21 2009 excellent value for Delhi Stayed one night at the beginning and one night at the end of our two week holiday. Support majority of positive comments already made about value, cleanliness and convenience. At the end of a long train journey the convenience of being able to walk to the Ginger Hotel was a great asset. The restaurant was nothing great but it's only one stop by Metro (entrance very close to the hotel) to Connaught Circus where there are plenty eating places. Would definitely stay there. Oct 19 2009 Good value for the money I was quite satisfied with my stay here. I stayed here my very first 2 nights in Delhi and on the trip. The hotel is basic but clean enough. Room has complimentary water (2 bottles a day), hot water pot, TV. Right now I can't even picture the bathroom but I was fine with the room and bathroom. There are 2 computers available in the lobby for Rs 110 for 1 hr. The staff was friendly and means to be helpful. One just has to give them time. I agree with the other reviews here in terms of the value for the money.The location was great for going to Old Delhi and Connaught Circle. Also, because it is next to the railroad station, the pre-paid taxi driver from airport knew how to get to it. There is a large sign up high so once at the station you can see it. There is construction around the station and you actually need to go to the back of the station to reach the hotel.A short walk from the hotels gets you to a pre-paid stand where you can hire auto-rickshaws. There is a booking agent (of sorts) in the hotel so I used them to book a car to the airport for the next leg of my trip. I said I would take non-AC for Rs800 and I got a car with AC.One negative was trying to book a room online. I did use direct email to the Delhi Ginger hotel but they don't book much in advance and they also get full quickly.Hope this helps. Oct 7 2009 Everything we wanted and nothing more! What can one get in New Delhi for 1000 rupees?The price, the location and the Tata brand were my main consideration when I booked Ginger for our 3 night stay in New Delhi. The location is amazing - bang next to the railway station. Yet so peaceful, as if away from the city.Once I got into the hotel, I didn't see a porter running towards me to pick up my baggage. Instead there were some super convenient trolleys - self-service is the mantra here.The room is not of a five-star quality but just of the right size and has everything one needs. In the common area, there is facility to iron your clothes. Amazingly designed to save costs and yet not compromise on the comfort of the stay.There is no room service, but you could pack your food from the restaurant and carry it yourself. Oct 3 2009 Perfect place for family An excellent hotel strategically located with very good Customer Service. The cost of the food in the Restaurant is little higher which TATA need to relook at, as they have opened this Hotel in the Railway Station Complex and not inside/ near Airport. Sep 30 2009 Can't ask for more - Real value for money Hats off to TATA for gifting us Ginger , Delhi. I booked this place after reading several reviews , but when I stayed there it exceeded my expectation. Positives : 1. Spacious and spick and span rooms for just Rs.999/night2. LCD TV3. Very neat toilet/shower4. Complementary mineral water ( 4 small bottles on daily basis)5. Centrally located - Connaught Place outer circle is hardly 1 km. CP is the best place to dine.6. 24hrs restaurant7. Water dispenser on every floor8. Very courteous staff including room service staff.These were just to name a few.Negatives :1. No auto stand in front of the hotel ( got to walk abt 50 mts)2. Restaurant not that great. They are not capable of handling more than 4 customers at a time. I had to wait for 1 hr to grab my breakfast. I suggest that you have food here only if unavoidable.3. The travel desk has very few Indica A/Cs. It has more bigger cars ,which are more expensive. Indica A/C Rs.850 / 8hrs-80kms ,but Esteem - Rs.600 more.Otherwise no complaints. I think Ginger should open similar hotels in Mumbai also.Wish you a very happy stay.Rgds,Venkatesh Sep 28 2009 Value For Money Real Value For Money hotel . An ac room at rs 999 . neat room well maintained . Has coffee / Tea maker , complimentary water bottle . Rs 999 is an steal . Sep 10 2009 Descent hotel at excellent price I was travelling to Delhi from Mumbai and this hotel came as a surprise choice after me completing the train ticket on irctc.co.inI was directed to www.railtourismindia.com and booking of this hotel was easy. Thought what services would I find for 1K room.Went to the hotel and voila, its an excellent located hotel (Central Delhi). Rooms are well maintained, lobby is good.They don't serve food in the rooms, but Comsum restaurent at the lobby provides yet another surprise. Good hygenic food at very good price.Overall very good experience. Aug 31 2009 LIKE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH...... We were on the way to Kerala and stayed here in a twin room. This was really a great beginning of Honeymoon. Clean and comfortable rooms with a multi-cuisine restaurant made our trip wonderful. We strongly recommend this hotel to all the visiting couples and families. One of the best thing is the easy access of railway station. You can even see your train standing at platform no. 10, 11 and 12 while having west side window opening rooms. Aug 21 2009 good value for money This hotel is just steps from the New Delhi train station. It has clean rooms, comfortable beds and decent bathrooms at very reasonable prices. The area around the station does look a bit intimidating but I never felt in danger, even late at night. The restaurant offers good and safe food at very competitive prices. Aug 18 2009 My most preferred hotel economical Ginger (Yatri Nivas) New Delhi, I recommend this hotel because its clean, the staffs are very polite, No disturbance, Overall I would say you get an ambeince of a five star at the cost of 3 star hotel. The rooms are very clean, the toilets are also clean. Clean bedsheets, towels, wifi, A/C. Really a comfortable place to stay and at the heart of New Delhi. The metro is just a 50 meter walk from the hotel. Isn't it Great !!! Aug 15 2009 THE best Value in Delhi for your money - period -- Great hotel with everything you need - mini fridge, flat panel TV , 4 beds in family room , free water bottles , separate shower,toilet,washbasin ( saves time when you have a family getting ready in morning ).Nice restaurent downstairs, WIFI for approx $8/24 hrs , pharmacy , book store next door etc .Just keep this quite guys - already too tough to get a room @ this place - seriously when I travel in India I am going to look for a Ginger hotel everywhere I go . Aug 4 2009 Noce Place But Not too Good I visited this place on my Recent visit to New Delhi. This hotel is good but is not ar per the desired standard. I know this is a budget hotel but the quality is not soo good. I have also visited the Bangalore Ginger hotel but this one in Delhi is not so good. Though rooms are neat and clean but the area where this is located is not good at all. Also there is not any room service at all. So this is also a problem. Jun 29 2009 The Best Hotel In Delhi After so much hassle in Raunak hotel,it was a relief to come to Ginger Hotel.I always searched for 3-4stars hotel.But after seeing the 3-star Raunak Hotel,i didn't want to anymore.Even though Ginger hotel is a budget hotel,it is the best value for money.The service was good,the food was splendid,the room was spacious and clean,the staff were very helpful and understanding.I really enjoyed my stay there. ..I really look forward to another enjoyable stay there!!! Jun 24 2009 Fabulous hotel great location for the railway station and VFM Stayed here on 2 separate occasions during March and rate the hotel very highly. Its location is walking distance from New Delhi train station which is ideal if you want to catch a train at 6 in the morning. The area around the hotel does not win any awards, in fact some parts look well dodgy, especially late at night. The hotel however has a security check point and they do actually check people coming into the hotel so no problems there. The rooms are very clean, modern looking, have a good air conditioning system, flat screen TV's, good hot showers and comfortable beds. Best of all the rooms are very inexspensive. There is a cafeteria down in the lobby area that serves various meals and drinks, the food is reasonable and good value. Jun 21 2009 Best place in Delhi to stay The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance. What I say that &quot;Best place in Delhi to stay&quot; Jun 21 2009 Best hotel near New Delhi railway station I had to take a train at 3:40 AM. So I was looking for a hotel which should be at a walking distance from NDLS station. The hotels at paharganj looked shabby. But Ginger hotel (The erstwhile Rail Yatri Niwas) is very nice hotel. The interiors are very good. The hotel uses latest technologies loke self check in etc. The room rates are also resonabel at around 1200 Rs. I would certainly recommed this hotel if you are looking for stay near new delhi railway station. Jun 19 2009 Budget hotel in India I'm a Brazilian living in Bangalore, and May this year my family came to visit me and my wife. I planned the visit to New Delhi and Agra, so I booked on-line two double rooms. Two weeks before I called to check if the reservations were really made, luckily it was! :) Finding this hotel is complicated, and if you're a foreigner, no taxi driver will believe you know where it is (even you have a map in your hands). Tell the driver that it’s next to Pinto Road, and that he has to go through the rail station car/rickshaw’s parking area to get to the hotel.The location is pretty good to visit the sites in New Delhi.This is a budget hotel, so don’t expect any frills. You’ll find a bed, AC (little noisy), LCD TV, a desk with a small fridge and a standard western bathroom. Our towels were a little dirty and the bed sheets where smaller than the bed, even thou cleaner than some 4 star hotels I’ve stayed in Pune, Chennai and Mumbai.There’s a 24 hours restaurant in the ground floor, if you like Indian food you’re going to enjoy yourself. If you don’t you can get an auto-rickshaw for 5-10 minutes and go to Connaught Place to eat something. The hotel does have omelette and toast.The hotel does deliver what it promises, a safe and clean place to sleep. If you’re looking for some glamour try other hotels, but if you don’t want to spend money, this should prove good enough. Jun 18 2009 yes yes yes! Even if it is not easy to get there (you can see it from the railway station but the road is not direct) we've found it very very worthy. Room is basic but clean, Wi-fi everywhere for 113 rupies per hour, the restaurant always open, not expensive and average quality food, just outside the door a pharmacy and a corner shop. Also a tourist desk is there, and their car rental with driver service is good and not expensive at all, compared to the others we checked. We will sure look for a Ginger hotel everywhere we'll go in India! Jun 13 2009 A good base in Delhi The Ginger is cheap, clean and comfortable.The air conditioning was welcome after the May heat of the city. We tried a 4 bed family room and the 2 bed twins, both fine, the twins have better bathrooms.The 24 hour cafe downstairs was useful, not the best food ever but adequate with a fair amount of choice.Tell cab drivers you need New Delhi station, Ajmeri Gate as others have noted they often don't know where the hotel is with just the name. The surroundings aren't wonderful but it is very convenient, the metro is just outside.Would definitely base myself here again. Good for families. Jun 13 2009 Budget at its best Hotel Ginger is a quality accomodation and a steal for the low prices that it offers. The fact that the building belongs to the Railways and was a Rail Yatri Niwas may have a major role to play in its pricing.But the makeover is unbelievable. Simple changes have made the hotel a great buy-in for business travellers who visit the hotel only for a good night's sleep.The rooms are very tiny but well done up. The corridors are a maze but blame it on the old building and construction.Currently accessibility from the city is a big problem because of the construction of Metro, but once that ends this hotel will be a hot favourite for people travelling by the Railways.Ginger provides option of ordering food from any local restaurant nearby and also makes available their menu cards, which is a great option if you want to choose from a variety of cuisine.All in all a value for money! Jun 12 2009 excellent value for the money Based on Tripadvisor reviews, I booked four nights at the Ginger Hotel in May and was not disappointed. The hotel provides excellent value for the money. I paid more than double for the same setup at another hotel when I returned to Delhi in June. The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance. Service is snappy and professional. While all this doesn't sound that exciting, trust me when I say that you'll be really thankful for such efficient service when you arrive at 4AM after being given the runaround by your taxi driver. The hotel is sort of hard to find. It's on the back side and across the tracks from New Delhi Station. Adjacent to the hotel is some sort of operations which involves lots of bales and carts and looks like recycling activity but is probably rail related freight operations. It's not pretty to look at, but the constant activity makes the area relatively safe, and once inside the hotel, all is nice and calm. You get courtesy bottles of water every day. There's internet access, albeit with a slow connection and expensive at 113 rupees an hour. And the restaurant isn't too bad. There's a metro very near by. If Delhi weren't so beastly hot, the hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place and Old Delhi. The place always seems to be booked, so book early. Jun 10 2009 romantic rooms The hotel is magnificent . It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go anywhere. It;s ambience is so peaceful, no disturbance at all from anyone . In delhi, with such a atmosphere you can not find hotel at such a reasonable rates. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel in the price range of Rs 1000/- per day. It is in the heart of delhi hence transportation is no problem at all. ONly negative point is its' entrance through New delhi Rly station which is little crowdy, but one you in it all peaceful, neat and clean rooms with very good aesthatics Jun 6 2009 Nice cute place We were scheduled to travel to Agra and planned to stop by at Delhi for a couple of business meetings. My brother was trying for hotel accomodation through the internet. He had a fancy for Ginger hotels and kept trying for a room from 1 month before our visit. He did not get one initially. But on repeated attempts, there appears to have been a cancellation and he was able to book a room.The hotel is just a stone's throw from the railway station. We flew down and took a taxi to the Station. We just walked over the platform into the hotel. We got an unbelievable price and when we walked into the hotel, the warm reception at the desk and the manners of the staff in the reception reminded us that this was a Tata hotel. Absolutely friendly, courteous and professional!When we went into the room, we saw a beautiful room with a spacious bathroom. It was an unbelievable facility for the price at this location. A tea kettle with coffee and tea packs was provided in the room.In case you get hungry, there is a restaurant in the groundfloor that offered food and beverage round the clock and we had arrived late at night without food and helped ourselves to a good tasty dinner there.A nice hotel at a very convenient place. But if you are planning to stay there, please make sure that you book a room well in advance. Jun 3 2009 for young independent travellers Very clean place to sleep and have a spot in the city. Do not expect a lot. Rooms are small, claustrophobic, with single window fully covered by AC machine. Older, old-fashioned ppl are really confused when they have to deal with card locks and all those modern tools. The area around the hotel isn't too safe, quiet or clean. It is just near the New Delhi station so u can imagine all that mess around and how is it at night. But one good thing is that u have a metro station just at the corner and 24hr Comsume in it. Food isn't great but safe. Jun 3 2009 Complete VFM Nothing but the best Value for Money.Easily the best option for all kind of travellers.Id give it 5/5 Jun 3 2009 Best Hotel at the Best Rate We used to visit Delhi quite often and it use to be a very difficult task to find a decent hotel at a decent price. Then the last time I was planning my trip to Delhi, I learnt that Ginger had opened in New Delhi and that to it is right next to the NEw Delhi Railway Station and so I booked Ginger. The hotel is very neat and clean and for the price I think one cannot get a better deal. They also have a restaurant, laundry service, LCD TVs in each room, etc. I think this hotel is a steal in Delhi for the price they are offering. Jun 2 2009 Good value for money Good value for money. The family room contains 4 beds. With AC, pretty spacious room with LCD TV for 1000 is too good. Also proximity the New Delhi railway station is BIG plus. Now don't have to go for the infamous Pahadganj hotels.Only issue was with respect to booking. I had done day visit booking with checkin and checkout dates as same. I had some trouble (had to wait for almost 1 hour) to get the room. And the reception staff and the manager were not polite to say the least. Jun 1 2009 Convenient Location A good value, conveniently located hotel next to the Metro and New Delhi Railway Station.It is located on the North East side of the Railway Station, taxi drivers might find difficulty in locating it!I had already checked it out on Google Earth and so we directed the taxi driver!The staff were very attentive and the restaurant was adequate. Hey, it is a budget hotel.We stayed four nights and the room was well cleaned every day.Yes, I would certainly return here, particularly if I was travelling by rail.Oh, there is also a pharmacy next to the hotel. May 31 2009 if you can only find this hotel... This was one of my worst experiences!!! I finished a whole days work in delhi &amp; had to return to this hotel in the night. The arrangement for my stay was made by my office in Mumbai. I tired calling the hotel serveral times during the day to inform them that i have arrived &amp; will be checking in only later that day, only in vain as no one answered the phone all throght the day.When i left to head to the hotel we reched the new delhi railway station, but NO ONE seemed to know where this hotel was located. I tried calling them up one again. As there was no answer &amp; since it was 12:30am i began to panick &amp; called a colleague in mumbai for some assistance. He gave me the same nos to dial but again all was in vain as no one answered.After almost 1.5hrs I finally managed to ask around &amp; we got to the hotel. I was furious. As i walked in i realised that there was absoluteley no one at the front desk, the phone too was ringing after looking around the front desk executive came &amp; asked : can i help you&quot; I gave him a piece of my mind &amp; asked him what kind of a hotel do you run. This was a chain affiliated with the TATA group.i the went to my room apart frm my bad experience, this a budget hotel costing apprx 1000rs. a night. There is no room service or house keeping. You have to dine a self service restaurant. The food is similar to your meals alavailable at a food court in any mall in mumbai. The food is average for the price.If you have a low budget then this is the place for you, if you can find it!! May 22 2009 Great hotel with excellent value We enjoyed staying at the Ginger, New Delhi. The rooms are compact, very clean and every small detail is taken care of (including complimentary bottles of water every day, wifi in each room, internet cafe etc) and the facilities are managed well.Food is available at the 24-hr coffee shop at the ground level. The service here is very slow though the food is nice. Pre-paid auto-rickshaws are available at the New Delhi railway station which is a 3 minute walk away and the metro station is 3 minutes away as well. The only issue is that auto will drop you off a 3-5min walk away on the return since the metro work has made the entire road difficult to enter. May 20 2009 Value for money hotel Good hotel to stay if you are travelling on business or work for a day or two. The facilities are minimal but adequate. May 20 2009 Great Value For Money We traveled BOM-DEL by Rajdhani Express. The hotel is just oppositte the New Delhi Railway station within the station premises. Its a fine 7 storeyed building with no frills and no excellent views from hotel room. BUT it offers great value for your money.We took a family room for just INR 1000. The room had 2 window AC's, 4 single beds. The entire room was very neat and tidy. Toilets were clean. Everything worked to perfection. Any other property in New Delhi offering what this hotel offers would easily cough up 2000-3000 bucks from your pocket.Seamless check-in and check-out procedure. Nice room service. 4 bottles of mineral water and tea and coffee kits provided on a daily basis. A nice 17 inch LCD TV to take care of your entertainment needs. The quality of the beds, mattresses is very nice.The restaurant offers a very limited menu. It is something which can be improved upon. May 18 2009 Best business class hotel in Mumbai Ginger hotel is truly a business hotel for a frequent business traveler like me.They best advantage with Ginger Delhi is its location advantage.The facilities provided by the hotel are above average.I specially like the Ginger concept and now I am a fan of it.I will definitely stay with Ginger next time I am in India's capital soon. May 11 2009 love the staff commitments towards service.............. it was a gud exp.. been serviced by the ginger mgt....at the cost tat i iccured i can't even imagine a service like the one i got ..................its true to say tata as the most trustable brand of world................ May 9 2009 Decent place - low cost Decent place- reasonably clean and located next to the railway station.. Remember it is a budget hotel so a few things one should keep in minda) Carry your toiletries!b) Food is available but is in a cafeteria like place Had a few issues with them messing up over the bedsheets but was otherwise ok May 9 2009 A Good Basic Transit Hotel A Basic Service Hotel, right next to New Delhi Railway Station , we took a 4 Bedded Family Room as were travelling with 2 Kids and wanted a Hotel Near Railway station as we were transitting next day to Goa by Flight.As we had seen Ginger in Haridwar and Goa and were impressed with the cleanliness chose this hotel.Very Nice Hotel, Location was bit bad due to Metro work on in the near vicinity , The Railway station Parcel office etc making it very noisy and dusty. But once inside it was nice.Rooms needed a little bit more care (by guests as well as by staff). On checkin found that Soap dispenser was empty and was taken away bu housekeping who forgot to replace it. The Toilet seat is installed too High making it uncomfortable. The size of the Toilet was too small. They should have selected better wc to fit the size.Linen was good, amenities Ok, size perfect, Restaurant at the Lobby level was good, economical and good.Best part is that you can go anywhere from here due to its central Location. May 8 2009 best budget hotel in new delhi in new delhi, in area near to railway station, ginger is not only best budget hotel but with most professional management.compare to other hotels in same area with same price tag, it is the best one, all facilities like taxi, food, shopping is available nearby. May 2 2009 loved the ambience the stay at hotel was awesome with excellent room amenities.and that too economical. jus the place outside hotel is to be maintained.. Apr 29 2009 Basic - but does exactly what you need for 1 night We initially booked this as we were going to be catching a train from Corbett National Park into New Delhi station (2 minute walk away). However we ended up catching a taxi from Corbett instead and our driver had all sorts of problems trying to get to the front door and ended up parking in a nearby car park! It's not in the nicest of areas, I definitely wouldn't advise walking around on your own at night.It is a standard stopover hotel, like a Travelodge or a Premier Inn in the UK. It's a pretty basic room, but has most that you need with air con, flat screen tv, tea, coffee and water. It's clean, the check in and out were simple and there's a restaurant/cafe downstairs. It's unbelievably cheap at about £14 for a night and with the money we saved here we went for drinks and dinner at The Imperial Hotel. Apr 23 2009 good price what I like about this hotel is the central location, and the attractive price for room it provides.It is basic, yet, it has what you need, and it is clean enough, although they do not provide sheets apart from the one covering the mat Apr 23 2009 Well worth the Money A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. The resteraunt is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive. Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only 2 mins away by foot. Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside the hotel. There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great. All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after 9pm this is a highly recommended hotel. The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is . It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system. Apr 19 2009 Decent The hotel is decent &amp; as per Ginger standards. The rooms are good&amp; clean. Its located very conviniently esp if one wants to travel from NDLS station or arives these late at night. On the negative side its in the congested &amp; poluted area of station &amp; u cant step out for a snack or stroll if u desire. Apr 18 2009 Inexpensive but know what you're getting into My friends and I booked a room at Ginger to save some money. It came highly recommended by my friend's coworkers in Bombay. However, we ended up not staying there. On the drive there, our driver muttered in Hindi that 'cheaters go there'. Then, as we waited to check in, the fellow customers, all men, started casually inching closer to my friends and me. We were a group of 3 20-something women, and two of us are white. While we may very well have been perfectly fine, it would have been nice to know about the area and clientele before we booked the room. Later in the week, my friend reconnected with a friend from Delhi who told us it's located in the Red Light district. That reaffirmed our choice to return to Claridges.Couples, men, families - I'm sure it's a great deal. Women traveling without male companions... it might be prudent to stay elsewhere. Apr 17 2009 Good Place Good place for a 2-3 days leisure time. The room service was quick and the food was satisfactory. The rooms were neat &amp; clean.I would recommend to the viewers to stay at this place. Apr 16 2009 Purely Smart Basics !! Loved my stay here. Hotel is clean &amp; proper. Has a good restaurant as well.Rooms are self sufficient, though small if you are looking at spending more than 3 days here.Staff is extremely helpful.Located right in the Delhi Railway Station premise, so good for Train travellers. At the same time, it's away from the hustle-bustle of the train travellers at the station.However, the entrance is a little dificult to locate the 1st time around. Entrance way is crowded as well, if coming via car.Also, if you are a very light sleeper, then the Honking of the night train can disturb you. But less likely. I slept like a LOG !!General store cum Medical store in Hotel complex is fully equipped, and is priced at MRP.Overall good experience for a one-2 nite stay for work. Mar 31 2009 Great value and excellent location Ginger was just what we needed for the final 3 nights of our 3 1/2 week stay in India.It was basically an Indian travelodge, so don't bother staying if you want an authentic heritage experience, but the room was immaculate (by western standards rather than Indian) and complete with a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities, TV, comfy bed, AC, etc.The location just outside New Delhi station was perfect for arriving/departing via the station, within walking distance of Paharganj and Connaught place, and a short metro ride to Old Delhi's main attractions (Red Fort, mosque, etc.) The 24 hour restaurant came in handy for our day trip to Agra and early morning flight back to London - staff at reception were also happy to ring for a metered cab to the airport when the travel desk in the foyer tried to charge us 1200Rs to get to the airport!At 990Rs a night, this was slightly expensive than other hotels we stayed in in India but worth every penny. Mar 16 2009 Excellent value but a bit of a nightmare outside It's an Indian TravelLodge. So excellent value for money, good clean room with a/c and good clean bathroom but basic decor and a bit echoey in the corridors. The restaurant / snack bar is good (try the plain dosa). It is a short trundle across the car park and through a little gateway from New Delhi railway station. You can't leave your luggage before / after check-in but there's a rather forbidding left luggage place in the station. The hotel has a perimeter fence and a security guard. Immediately outside, you're in a horrendous noisy tide of hand carts, jeeps, motorbikes etc - or you can hit lucky and find it pretty quiet. Getting in is OK if the taxi knows the circuitous route to the entrance. Otherwise, they'll drop you right by the building and it is quite a challenge to find the way in. Expensive internet. Mar 15 2009 Very nice and clean hotel but the restaurant Very nice clean hotel with good room facilities, good location just at Ajmeri gate 100m from NDRS and metro, nice stuff - willing to fully refund one mine canceled night, but also sometimes act too bureaucratically. Hotel restaurant is a different story. It works like fast food and they had no croissants and breakfast like food at the morning even if listed in the menu. Same with fruit salad. Mar 11 2009 Exceptional value in a big city! We stayed for two nights early March and then again a week later. Both times the rooms were immaculate, we stayed in a double room costing just 999 rupees per night, the rooms are equipped with Satellite TV, kettle, tea and coffee, fridge, celan bathroom with shower curtain, these are a rarity in India! We had a problem with our toliet on the second visit but maintenance were at the door almost as soon as we had put the phone down from calling reception, and the problem was rectified.The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from New Delhi station which makes it perfect for early morning train journeys. We too had a problem with a taxi driver not knowing where the hotel was, but we also had a tuk-tuk driver who didn't know where Connaught Place was?!?!? The staff in the hotel are really helpful and work really hard to keep everyone happy, they even called Domino's pizza for us as we were having trouble with their pay phone. Feb 28 2009 Value hotel in a good location Good value hotel, Clean rooms very close to the train station. good choice for a nights stay in Delhi before your onward jurney. Feb 21 2009 Absolute value for money no frills located right next to Railway station A Compact small room with wooden flooring, clean bathroom, with a telephone, air-conditioner and a cupboard with hangers was all for Rs 999. A standard room means a Queen side double bed, whereas a twin bed room are two separate beds. There is also a category with four beds at the same price if there are more people! The rooms are small, and one could compare this with Ibis in Europe, only that dust in India makes it harder to keep the property as clean. But no complaints.There is a restaurant at the ground floor (Comesum) which serves decent food options. The location is excellent, next to the Railway station and to Connaught place, N Delhi. When we stayed, there was lots of metro rail construction happening around the hotel which made access slightly round-about. However, we could walk to the railway station early morning strolling our bags on our own (there are baggage strolleys available in the hotel restricted till the main entrance of the hotel) in about 7 minutes.The laundry service was reasonable and prompt - deposit in the morning and receipt by evening 8 pm.We booked online and check was easy too. There is a helpful reception desk. The hotel is quite busy due to the price and location, and one needs to bear with that.Overall, a comfortable and convenient stay. Feb 11 2009 good value for Rs 1200 I stayed here once alone and once with my wife in January 2009 for Rs 1200. Overall a good hotel but there is a problem in getting taxi drivers to find it. Most don’t recognize the address whether spoken or written down. But I eventually go there on every ride, with perhaps a ten minute delay. It is a forty-five minute car ride to and from the airports, don’t use a rickshaw. Rooms were Spartan but spotless on both visits. The lobby was slightly less clean yet more than adequate for a quick stop over in Delhi. The restaurant had reasonable food and prices (Rs 60-100/entrée), but the menu was limited during any given meal. Feb 7 2009 Ginger Hotel Our stay at the Ginger Hotel was great. Forget expensive bed and breakfast hotels, the Ginger Hotel is a no frills, and a great hotel. Our family of 4 stayed in 2 rooms as the family room (1000INR) was totally booked. We stayed in a double and 2 singles rooms (1000INR each) for 3 days. We arrived at the hotel which is located next to the NDLS railway station. It was chaotic outside. We approached the hotel gates, security didn't let the car through (security check), we got off, and headed towards the lobby. Check in was a bit of pain as Indians don't understand getting in line to get attention. We were soon given our room keys and went upstairs. We but our bags in the trolly. THe rooms were clean, and had the basic necessities. 4 water bottles inside the room. Heater and AC were part of the room w/ remote control. TV was LCD. Internet was expensive but we didn't care as we were at the hotel to only catch night sleep. THe floor consisted of an iron table in the hallway. THe hotel at the lobby is superb. Order watever you want as they are open 24 hrs, indian/chineses/western and is clean. We ate dinner here every night as we were sure not to get sick. THe hotel also has a gym and meeting room. Newspaper free at lobby. No outside noise was noticibly. Pick this hotel if you want a inexpensive 3.5 star service. It's centrally located to all monuments, and shopping areas are a taxi drive away. Since it's located near the train statin catching a taxi/or a 3 wheeler was a breeze. Walk outside the gate and towards the train station, there you will find an office for the 3 wheelers. Tell them where you want to go and you will prepay your trip. No negotiating. For taxi, the black taxis are outside too but here you have to talk to the drivers. We took a taxi to the airport for 400INR but all intercity trip to visitor monuments/shopping were done in tuktuk (3 wheelers). Would I stay here? In a heartbeat. Save the money and use that on shopping. You are on vacation and will use the bed for only night 8 hrs of sleep anyway. I spent 3500INR for a bed and breakfast hotel on the last stay which was pathetic (house of lords), spend the money at Ginger. Make sure you prebook online if you want the Family room (4 ppl for 1000INR) as it's in HOT demand. We couldn't get the deal so we took the regular rooms for 2 at 1000INR each which is still great. Staff is super friendly, will go out of the way to help. They've even got a ground transportation group at the lobby but I thought they were expensive. A medical store exists in the lobby as well. Request a room in the higher floors for a greater view. See pics of the location. This is a gem in the city no doubt. Coming into a foreign country from the US is a headache but staying at Ginger will calm the situation a LOT. Feb 6 2009 Great value for Money Stayed at Ginger during a short trip to Delhi in January 2009 with friends. There were 3 of us, so we got the Family room which has 4 beds for Rs.1000/nightThe stay was comfortable and just what it advertised itself as - a no frills hotel. Though service at the hotel was good, there were areas for improvement. 1. The hotel provides only 2 towels in a room meant for 4 persons and you need to ask them for extra towels. The towels could be of better quality - they shed threads which stuck all over!2. Wifi/Internet access is expensive at Rs.130/hour compared to internet rates elsewhere3. The room key card repeatedly stopped working and meant a trip to the lobby each time to fix it!On the positive side,The staff was very polite and helpful. The 24 hour cafe is convenient, especially when you need to leave at odd hours of the night. The food wasn't bad either :)Having a metro station at your doorstep is really usefulThe beds were very comfortable or maybe I was just really tired. The location of the hotel near the New Delhi Railway Station and Metro station is convenient BUT it also means that road access to the hotel can be confusing, as it is in an area surrounded by a parking lot and a railway parcel area.Overall, if you aren't going to spend a lot of time in your hotel room and just need a comfortable, safe and clean place to spend the night Ginger is the place for you, but don't expect a full service hotel. There are still a few kinks they need to iron out but the helpful staff fixes any problems quickly.I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Delhi. Feb 5 2009 Good Hotel Hotel was good and neat and clean. As I presume they are a no frill hotel where we need to fetch our water as well. I guess they can modify those a bit. The toilets and the bath does not have any buckets or mugs. If you have a kid you are in for some trouble with that. No room service or bell boys are there. Not a bad choice for a stay next to NDLS station Jan 16 2009 Great value for a family of 4 We stayed in 12/2008 twice for 2 nights each in a family room which sleeps 4. The first time the room was not very cléan - but the second time it was. Great location - great price (INR 1000 per night). If you check in later or check out earlier they automatically give you a reimbursement. The surrounding area is not recommended to go for a walk.Due to heavy construction work and proximity to the railway station it does get loud if you wish to keep the window open. There are however 2 A/Cs in the family room and 2 fans.The 24 hour restaurant in the basement is OK - its clean and has a wide variety of dishes: southindian, north indian, even blackforest cherry cake ;-)The car rental service in the hotel is however a rip-off. Book your transport elsewhere. Staff is friendly and helpful. You can also get your clothes washed there. Internet access works most of the time. Jan 12 2009 Nice enough close to New Delhi railway station We pre-booked a room in Ginger hotel for our first night in Delhi. The taxi driver had serious problems to get to the hotel as the hotel is next to an enormous parking lot for rickshaws as well as the train station. However, he got us there and we were greeted by the friendly staff. Our room on the 5th floor wasn't that spacious but nice. Clean sheets, flatscreen TV and complimentary bottles of water as well as teabags and coffee. The bathroom wasn't the cleanest we have ever seen but good enough. As we were leaving for Rajasthan, we decided to spend one more night a week later. We asked the front desk staff upon checkout about making a reservation for that night. They said that there were rooms available. However, they could not make the reservation - we had to do it through the Ginger website... To use their internet access, we would have to pay more than a 100 rs for a wireless card. (1 hour costs about 35-40 rs at any internet café in town)The next time we came to Delhi, we found out that the metro is extremely close to the hotel, about 25 metres from the hotel gate. There is however no metro sign so you have to ask the guard to show you the direction. Ginger hotel is also very close to the railway station which is convenient for early morning departures but also causes noice at night. The hotel isn't five-star but for the price, it's definitely recommended! Jan 10 2009 RESERVATION NOT HONORED- left stranded My friend is stranded in Delhi because Ginger Hotel didn't honor her reservation. They had record of the reservation but there were no rooms available. It's the middle of the night, her first trip to India and I'm here in the US desperately trying to google some kind of alternative. So...BE CAREFUL. Double check that they are ready for you. Otherwise it's a great place to stay. Jan 9 2009 Great value for money with few kinks As an NRI family from USA, including 2 teenagers , and traveling in India for the first time, we were a little apprehensive about our Indian travel agent's recommendation re this hotel. However, overall experience for our 2 rooms over 5 nights turned out to be excellent . We checked in at 3AM on 12/19 and checked out on 12/24 without any problems. They gave us partial credit for the 1st night, which was a pleasant surprise. Access to the hotel is cumbersome, but since we had hired a private car with a driver, this was not a problem for us.Best things were front desk svc, 24hr restaurant (cheap, lots of variety, mild food, good svc), laundry svc, cleanliness, uninterrupted hot and cold running water, free water bottles, free tea &amp; coffee, and access to a safe. We did not miss not having room service. Although the family room does have 4 beds, it is very small and quickly got congested with all our baggage. So our decision to book 2 rooms, and have access 2 bathrooms and extra space turned out be a good one. The biggest issue was inconsistent housekeeping svc; e.g. some days we got only 1-2 towels or no TP for 4 people; one day no svc at all. They always fixed the problem promptly upon complaining, but it did not have to be this way. The only other issue was night time noise at the Rlwy Stn, which we drowned out by running the A/c fan without the A/c. Also, WiFi broke the 2nd day and never got fixed, even though they said it would be fixed within a couple of hours - a problem not unique to Ginger, but commonly encountered in India.If you want a 5 star hotel, Ginger is not for you. But I would definitely recommend this hotel to any family that wants basic modern value for money. Jan 8 2009 Good value for money and good location Stayed at the Ginger New Delhi, mainly because of the location - it was a few mins walk to the train station and metro line so that is why we chose it.Overall, it was really good value for money, clean hotel and friendly staff.ROOM - room was an adequate size, wooden flooring and clean. The bathroom was a wet room but I found the toilet was a little high - such that when you were sat on the loo, your legs wouldn't touch the floor :-)The complimentary water provided in the room was really good and a nice touch.SERVICE - there was a restaurant bolted next door to the hotel with access from the hotel which served food which was great as it meant we didn't have to start hunting around for breakfast.LOCATION - it was very conveniently positioned which was handy as we were catching the 0615 train to Agra so we just had to hop out of bed, and walk to the train. The location meant that you could hear the station announcements and was noisy at times, but we were in a city after all, so noise was expected. Ear plugs are something I now carry with me at all times!OTHER - there was a little room which had complimentary water, iron and ironing board, and newspapers which was nice to have.COST - very good value for money - can't fault this hotel on this!Overall, I would definitely stay again, great little hotel, clean, good value for money - what more to do need! By no means was it the Ritz but it was functional - just what we needed! Jan 5 2009 A good value hotel in Delhi I choose this hotel after extensive research of hotels in Delhi.The thing that finally swung it for me, was that is was cheap.The selection of hotels in Delhi swings from the cheap to the ridiclious.The Ginger seemed to be a hotel that served the purpose of being a safe,clean bed for a couple of nights.We flew in from Goa, for a couple of days of sightseeing, a day trip to Agra and then onward to Jaipur.This hotel was adequate for that purpose.The good points were, clean rooms, serviced daily, on site 24hrs cafe, close to the new delhi railway station, great for catching the shatbadi express at 06.15 to AgraThe bad points, the construction work of the metro makes the area chaos, a taxi ride from anywhere else, you over look an interesting area!, expensive wi-fiConclusion: If you want a good value, clean hotel in Delhi, the Ginger hotel is a good option Dec 3 2008 Value for Money Surprisingly Rooms at Ginger Hotel was available for the dates that I was traveling to New Delhi. it was an hazel to reach the hotel, with all the construction work going on around it, and its location near the station gave jitters. All these was only till we reached to the hotel. The people at the reception were friendly and the room, pretty clean and tidy. Could not say it was big, but was sufficient for 2 persons. The only point of concern was the food at comesum restaurant housed inside, the food was just edible! though the live music at the restaurant was pretty good.Overall the hotel is complete value for money Nov 22 2008 Excellent Value This is the best value hotel I've ever been to. Its thoroughly modern, with all the basic facilities (including payed Wi-Fi at rooms). The location is good too, with Metro station right outside, and one metro stop away from Connaught Place (i.e., 5 minutes). Also, its easily booked online. The downsides - the shower area is a bit small, and the beds are very light (which can be a bad thing if you want them to stay put). Its also quite busy just outside, due to the railway station (Indian Railways, not the metro). There is no room service, though the affordable 24 hour restaurant Comesum is decent. Nov 10 2008 best thing about the hotel is self service .. loved the ambience i have recently gone through a very fantastic service in the hotel industry in india..the service provided to me was through the hotel ginger in new delhi..the system of help yourself is catching up fast in india and much to my delight the price of the hotel is fair enough to shell my wallet. Nov 8 2008 Leisure at very low cost I usually go on my bussiness trip to New Delhi. I prefer to stay in in Ginger Hotel. It has all the facilities that any four star hotels would have . Moreover easy to check In. Good Bed and superb guest service Nov 4 2008 Excellent Value for money Excellent value for money.. Neat and clean. Within the New Delhi Station, hence a great choice for people travelling to or from there. There is a 24 hour medical shop and a vending machine for those late night hunger pangs. All of this for less than a thousand bucks !! Oct 30 2008 Superb! Best choice at New Delhi Train Station We have been there in Sept 2008.It is directly located at New Delhi Train Station.Cleanest hotel we had in whole India in this price range around 1000Rs. Reservation by internet or phone. TV, a/C, 24h warm water, clean linen. Oct 23 2008 Excellent Deal.. No one could imagine such an excellent stay at the heart of New Delhi.I stayed for 4 Nights. The room was perfectly Clean. I will definitely opt this hotel again if I visit Delhi againThe Price was the great attraction. It cost just 1000 rupees. But It gave the facilities &amp; comfort of 4000 Rs room. Superb.. Real Value for Money Sep 15 2008 More than Value for Money. This is a new Budget range Hotels from Tata Group operated with the brand name Ginger and Tata Group also owns the Taj 5* Hotels in India &amp; Abroad.An existing 7 Floors Rail Yatri Niwas which was managed by Indian Railways has been handed over to Ginger Hotels to run the Buget Hotels and it has been refurbished completely and opened in August 2008. With the Hotel Pricing at 1000-1200 for AC Room with LCD TV, Mini Regrigerator with small but neat and clean rooms you cant ask anything more. The biggest surprise was even a 4 Bedded Family Room also was priced at Rs. 1000 with Two AC's. They have WIFI Zone, Mini Gym, 24hrs Restaurant, Vending Machine and also a 24hr Pharmacy Center within the complex. I had seen around 15-20 International Tourists staying at this place. The Rooms are with Dark Shades with basic interiors and Hot &amp; Cold Water. No Room Service is provided and they manage with few staff and thats where they are able to cut down the costs. However compared to other Ginger Hotels this one is priced at much lower rate I guess it could be because of the agreement with Indian Railways because they have provided the Land &amp; Building.

Staff were helpful, area was dodgy. Nov 3 2009 Worst hotel why i come here ? I was confirming at hotel classic. The room service was good if you put some money for the house keeping. The price they charge for the rooms are again too high for what you want to get. Management should be ashamed of them. Nov 2 2009 Nice Clean Hotel Near Metro We travelled Delhi in group tour of India of Delhi Agra Jaipur Jaiselmer. Hotel Classic is nice clean hotel with good facilities. We were served well by smiling staff. Hotel is near metro station will lift which in useful for old person like us. Sep 30 2009 Loved The Classic Hospitality Hotel Classic is Classic in all means. I was planning to cancel my trip to India due to disturbances in India but Owner Jitendra Chadda helped me on email and assured that he will take care of us. I am happy that I believed on him. He made our trip easy by making all our trips confirmed. Pickup person was always smiling (I was very annoyed with Cusom person at Airport) but he took care of our luggage. Rooms were cleaned with all basic amenities. We were upgraded to executive room on third floor at no extra cost which was surprise for us. Breakfast was good in room. Wifi was complementry at lobby and I found it very useful. We would be returning here next month on our way back. Sep 7 2009 Excellent Stay I have been visiting India's cities for last 2Months. This hotel has been most comfortable and memorable experience. After being picked from Airport in Air Conditioned Car we were given upgraded room on arrival. Service was good. Hot showers worked early morning (Surprising in Indian Cities). Even breakfast was served at 5AM on my request. Location is good with all food joints nearby. Lots of shopping also. Overall my experience was excellent. Thanks to management. Jun 20 2009 Bad Experience I booked the hotel on internet after seeing good reviews but on my arrival uncleaned room given to me but when i request the front desk they tell me to wait for 2 hours but after that they shift my room and again there was same problem. But at last they solve the problem. Over all experience was bad the room service was not good. The front manager was polite and good but service was zero.My over all experience was bad even manager approach me to put good review for the hotel and agree to give me the discount.... May 5 2009 Could be cleaner great location for metro We arrived in the middle of the night having been picked up by taxi (read two chaps in someone's small car which unnerved us a little) arranged by the hotel prior to our arrival which wasa lot less hassle than trying to deal with mayhem at the airport at midnight. We stayed for two nights and found the staff to be really helpful and the service great, with room service at pretty much any time of night or day. The constant Bollywood blaring out of the reception TV was a little offputting at 3 o'clock in the morning but nothing compared to the rest of the noise in Delhi. Our room was quite large and had table and chairs and a sofa as well. The bed was large and quite comfortable, but the sheets weren't the cleanest I've ever seen and it didn't help that we didn't realise we were supposed to remove the wierd pillow cases before getting into bed. The bathroom was a bit grim, but no grimmer than any of the other hotels we stayed at in India during the fortnight that we stayed. The major bonus about this hotel is that it is in the middle of a slightly quieter surburban district and it is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station, which for Westerners is the easiest, cheapest, least hassle method of getting round. The area was packed with shops,restaurants and one of the only department stores I saw. The metro being so close was perfect. although being separated (boys in one line, girls in another) for X-Ray scanning prior to embarking everytime was certainly an interesting method of security that I doubt passengers would tolerate on the Tube. There are probably other better value perhaps slightly cleaner hotels out there, but for first time visitors to India we found this easy, hassle-free, OK value for money, with good service, good English communication, and ideally situated for an initial foray into Delhi. May 4 2009 Loved the Hotel N Staff Good Clean Budget Hotel in Market Area Koral Bugh. We had beed reffered by friends who visited last year. It was very nice experience. Staff very friendly. Mar 6 2009 great for two women travelling alone pick up at airport was spot on, the man with placard with my name on it waiting for us, with the hustle and bustle of Delhi airport this was abonus for RS900 to arrive safe at the hotel, I also booked day tours to Agra and Jaipur,RS850 each.A/C bus for both, mostly Indians are the tourists that board these buses, so you have some good times joking about how much extra westerners have to pay to visit monuments. The hotel was clean comfortable beds and occationally hot water, but to be fair we were geting up at 5am to go on the trips. Breakfast we had in our room as there is no dining room, but this was nota problem, as a couple of times we had a meal in the evening, there is a good S,Indian restraunt round the corner and a modern food court. The area of the hotel did not make us feel afraid to walk out in the evening, sometimes we did not get back from trips till midnight. The staff are a real jolly gang and could not do enough to help us, they booked a local taxi to take us round Delhi for the day and this is probably the best way to see most things in Delhi.I had been e mailing the owner for a couple of months prior to my visit, so when I met him it was like meeting an old friend. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, it is a quiet retreat in the busy noisy city that is Delhi. Mar 3 2009 Stay in Delhi Hotel was refered to us through common friend. But before placing booking on Expedia we crosschecked the reviews and foud it very satifactory. We were picked up from Airport on request to hotel and were given room on 3rd floor as requested in mail.Hotel is central located , clean, near to metro tube station. Nearby Mcdonald was a blessing for us.Hotel Manager arranged tour for us to Agra and Jaipur.We loved to stay here and recommend it to our friends surely. Feb 17 2009 Bed bugs We stayed here for just one night prior to returning home......the whole appearance is shabby however we were not prepared for the rude awakening by the bed bugs...very large bed bugs. On complaining at the front desk we were told they'd move us the next day which was useless since we were leaving. They brought up a bug spray and 'clean' bedding which in fact looked even dirtier.No breakfast is included and to be honest I'd really have my doubts on the standard of hygiene in food preperation...therefore we did not call for any room service.Its not a cheap hotel and better can be found for the price in this area. Feb 14 2009 nice clean hotel at great location The location is very convenient for the metro - a 5 minute walk down a busy shopping street brings you to the hustle and bustle of the road where the metro station is, and then it's only 3 stops to Rajiv Chowk Connaught Place. There's an internet terminal in the lobby and wi-fi .The staff is fabulous, always eager to help and friendly I needed an Indian SIM card for my cell phone. The duty manager sent his assistant on foot at 9 pm to escort us with the necessary documents to get a card.The pickup as promised was there and were taken to the hotel which took about 30 minutes. we were greeted at the reception nicely and were checked in . All facilities were there as written in Reviews. Must Try their Breakfast in Bed!!!!! Feb 4 2009 grungy hotel Really quite expensive for a grungy little hotel. The location is fairly central and close to the metro that's about it. The rooms look pretty tired, tv had poor reception and no complimentary breakfast. On arrival after a long trip went to get into bed but found the sheets and duvet cover were really dirty and stained. We phoned to ask for clean sheets but the sheets the staff brought up were worse than the ones already on the bed. They went through several sets of sheets looking for clean ones but found them all in a similar state with blood stains, greese spots and/or holes. They gave up after looking through several sets &amp; up and opened a brand new set for us. For IRs 2811 (approximately US $60.00) we expect clean sheets. Jan 26 2009 Superbly Sited Classic As with most travellers, we arrived in the middle of the night, so we didn't see too much. As part of our stay we arranged for the hotel to pick us up from the airport, saving a huge amount of time &amp; hassle. The next morning we found that we were in the very safe &amp; friendly Karol Bagh. The hotel itself was clean &amp; functional, nothing flash. However, what made the stay so memorable was the helpfulness of the staff and the hotel's location. Go up the street &amp; turn right and there's a very good, cheap, vegetarian restaurant. Turn left &amp; there's a 24 hour ATM that accepts foreign cards (very handy as it takes forever to change money in the bank). Go down the street &amp; you're in the thick of the Karol Bagh market where you can buy anything &amp; everything very cheaply. Turn left and the metro station is at the end of the street. From here you can see a lot of the city easily and inexpensively (11 rupees to the Red Fort). Jan 17 2009 Not worth it There is nothing really wrong with this hotel but you can do better for the price.The room was clean, with TV, hot water, etc.The staff were fine - although sent me to get ripped off when buying a SIM card from their friend.Airport pick up was good but you can do it for MUCH cheaper. They charge 900 INR, when you can get there easily for 300 INR. Jan 16 2009 Does not offer WiFi in the way they advertise it! One of the reasons I liked the sound of this hotel was because of the other reviews saying the WiFi access is good.However, when I arrived they said I could only access the internet from the lobby. The lobby is very small and the only seating area is next to the reception desk, practically blocking the main thoroughfare of the hotel.This is an inconvenience, not a value add. Not at all comfortable and certainly not appropriate for any more than 5-10 min use. Dec 25 2008 Clean Affordable Hotel in Bustling Delhi Very Clean Hotel in Busting Delhi. Very Cheap and found same as given in reviws. A;port p;up OK. Staff help to guide you for city vision and Jaipur. Provided hot B;fast in Room very early morning. Very happy to book this hotel. Dec 22 2008 Perfect Hotel for Our Short Visit This is Nice Hotel in Market Place Koral Baugh. We were very worried for our agents choice of hotel before arriving India. But our worries vanished when we arrived at Hotel Classic. Agent made a perfect choice as we required clean but not costly rooms. Hotel was extremely clean. Staff was very cheerful and replied to my queries about Agra. We are a group of 7 persons came for Taj Visit. We were provided with our choice of breakfast in our bed as we did not wanted to have breakfast anywhere else. Dinner was also very good. We will visit again on our return trip. Nov 23 2008 GREAT START OF TRIP!!!!!!!!!!! Great Great Great. Our Start of Tour has been Excellent. We booked this hotel by watching reviews of this hotel. I did not expected that organising Indian tour could be so much easy. I requested Airport pickup at midnight and hotel offered pickup for US$20 instead of US$25 as listed in website. They were prompted in replying and confirming. Maduu Hotel Pickup person was waiting for us in A/C Car. Room was same as shown in website. No Carpets with Wifi at Lobby-FREE. Now at Indore I called hotel and thanked. We will definately visit hotel again on my way back to US. Oct 24 2008 good hotel I spent 3 nights in this hotel.Rooms were quite good, clean and not noisy.I would avoid room 104 and 107 on 1st floor, since they are next to some a/c machines and imagine are quite noisy.Staff was nice, spoke good english and helped me whenever i asked for.Hotel is 5 min walking from metro station.The hotel almost meets western standards and i would recommend it to a friend. Oct 6 2008 Love It Our Uncle Booked 2 Rooms for us in this hotel. Before comming here we were very afraid to travel to India due to Bombs and terrorist attacks. But for a marrige sake in Mogga(Punjab) we had to come. But we are happy that we were in safe hand of this good hotel in croweded Delhi. Pickup was excellent in Big Cab with one of hotel person standing with placard at morning odd hours. Rooms were very comfortable. Free Wifi is available at Reception area due to security reasons. Staff very helpful. We are moving today to Punjab and will be back in this hotel again next week for overnight stay. Sep 3 2008 An acceptable Delhi hotel The Hotel Classic is an average mid-range hotel in the bustling Karol Bagh district. The good: - The hotel is very cheap. We paid 1500 rupees per night for a private AC room.- The room service menu (including breakfast) is very cheap for basic but tasty food. We had Indian food one night from there for dinner at it was delicious and extremely cheap.- The hotel can arrange reasonably priced transfers and pick-ups to the airport and train station (but with issues, see below)- It is only a 5 minute walk to Delhi’s excellent Metro system which can take you to Connaught Place and Old Delhi without having to sit in traffic.- The room and bathroom are clean.- The Air Con is very effective.- Laundry is reasonably priced.The not so good:- The view from the room is of another building, and is not nice at all.- The TV has only Indian channels. - The location is so-so. If you’re a white person, you stand out a bit in the very busy area of Karol Bagh.- There is no in-room safe.- The bathroom is basic (clean, though) and has no shower curtain.- We had to check out of the hotel at 3am and get to the airport quickly. I had pre-arranged a transfer with the hotel to pick us up at 3:15am, but when we came to the lobby with our bags etc there was no record of any booking being made. They were able to get us a car in ten minutes though (resplendent with totally shattered windscreen).- Hot water is sporadic so expect a few cold showers.I would not advise people against this hotel, but I don’t think I could recommend it either. I suspect there are better located, nicer hotels in Delhi. It all comes down to how much you want to spend. Aug 29 2008 A most excellent starting point in India!!!!! This hotel turned out to be the PERFECT starting point for our visit to India. Mr. Jitender made arrangements for our driver and car and also set me up with a local travel agency to make other hotel arrangements in India.There is no room for error when traveling in India...so the driver Mr. Jitender arranged for us was most important. His name was Suresh, and he was incredible. The hotel was very inexpensive by my travel standards as I am used to paying $100 to $200 per night. Classic was our first impression of India...and the staff there was friendly, warm and welcoming. As we arrived late, they even took my morning breakfast order and then delivered it to me right on time! Thank you Mr. Jitender for making our India trip a success. Aug 8 2008 very helpful staff great location, near the metro station. the room is clean and the hotel staff are very helpful,especially the manager. train,flight reservation can be made thru this hotel and the most important thing, u can chat and get informations online from the staff Jul 25 2008 Clean generally acceptable room This is an inexpensive hotel in a very crowded neighborhood that will probably be very foreign and confusing to most westerners. I stayed here for two nights upon arriving in India, and while the hotel itself is fine, above average value by Indian standards, I would advise staying at a Western hotel for a couple of days upon arrival to acclimate to India.The good: rooms are clean; I though my room smelled bad, but then I realized the problem was that my window did not shut completely, and so was letting in the smell of Delhi. Furniture is acceptable, the bed is quite comfortable, and while nothing about the room is spectacular, it is acceptable, at the level of budget accommodation in the US, and I was fine paying the posted price for the room. The airport pickup was smooth. The staff dealt with me honestly, quoting me prices for cars and services that turned out to be quite reasonable and fair. I appreciate this. One desk worker made a call in Hindi for me, which was very nice. They gave me a wakeup call (2 other places I stayed at in India forgot). There was a computer with a slow Internet connection right next to my room that I used several times, without being charged. They routed several phone calls to my room for me. The bill was handled in a straightforward, efficient manner.The bad: hot water was in and out (this was true in all of India for me), I couldn't get the cable TV to work, the driver they found for me was a dishonest shyster, as near as I could tell I was the only guest, yet there was a staff of about 10 Indians milling around the lobby at all times, which was intimidating and weird. The location, in my view, is less than ideal for a tourist, it is hard to find; at any rate, I would recommend getting a driver for the whole day and not attempting to go on foot from here. The view out my window was of a filthy courtyard, and the windows did not shut completely.This is acceptable accommodation, and while there are nicer hotels to be had for more money, if this is what fits your budget, I think you can feel good about staying there. May 5 2008 Always the Best We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday in India and for 2 nights at the end(now too hot to stay here), the first part in a room and the second in a suite.The suite was large, clean and quiet.The staff were courteous, obliging and quietly efficient.This was the one decent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference.I asked to have breakfast served in my room. Once again, no problem at all, no extra charge for the brilliant and quick room service. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Delhi. Apr 30 2008 Loved the Classic with Classic Service Hotel has the best service you could want. They made us feel right at home, and went out of their way to supply all our needs and more. All of the staff made us feel comfortable and were very respectful. Arriving in Delhi at 10pm we got off the plane to find Madhusudan waiting for us with a welcoming smile. We found the service and the staff a delight; they did everything to make us feel at home. They indeed provided me assistance in providing air tickets to Mumbai for tomorrow without any service charge. I recommend this hotel to everyone in my friends and relatives. Mar 29 2008 Peacefull Hotel in Hectic Delhi This was the one decent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference. Very cool place, peaceful and stylish. Good service and not that expensive though not sure how much we paid. Its not the best value for money we have had but worth spending up for. I have now few hours to linger at Delhi Airport, so thought of posting review instead of crushing down in rush at counters.Management owner was great help in arranging tours for us.Market is just walking distance and location is Lively only drawback is traffic noice during day but as night crawls in all get smoothened up.There's a computer and desk provided in the passage area and the internet connection is good. The laundry service was also good and we had no problems with anything we got back, and thought that we probably could have trusted it with more than we did.We also hired the hotel's driver &amp; car for a few hours for some sight-seeing around Delhi and were pleased with the service. Mar 5 2008 Impressed with Service I am still staying in this hotel. Extreeeeemly clean :-). Loved thy are treating us. I must say I have travelled a lot in South East Asia this Season but the service, facilities and management is uncomarable to any 3* hotel anywhere. They kept person waiting at Airport even our flight was late almost 3hours and they didn't charge extra penny for such delay. We are here blessed with Free Wi Fi with compliments of management. Owner /Boss ?? is wonderful guy assisting our local trips with detailed maps- that too complimentry!!!!. Staff here is attentive to our calls and swing into action whenever required. Location is wonderfull- in busy busy market. Pollution -Key factor Govt should look into. Just two blocks away is metro station connecting to main city centre-CP. Jan 24 2008 Great little hotel I booked this hotel for 2 nights after having seen some positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Rechecking Trip Advisor shortly before I left for Delhi I was concerned to see that subsequently a couple of very poor reviews had been posted, one of which suggested that guests had been somehow induced to write good reviews. It was therefore with some trepidation that I decided to stick with my original reservation, and in fact it was too late to cancel anyway. I am happy to report that, for me, this was an excellent choice of hotel. I thought it was full of real charm. The pre-booked transfer from the airport could not have been smoother, especially given that my flight was over 2 hours late arriving. Most of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I really liked the room I was given. In fact I simply cannot understand why the poor reviews were posted. Were they really staying at the same hotel? Can the other rooms really be so different in terms of cleanliness?, this would seem highly unlikely to me. Maybe the hotel has simply got its act together following the unfavourable reviews. My room was extremely clean, cosy, quiet and had everything one might need (television, fridge, telephone, writing desk, comfy chairs, extremely comfy bed). The furniture may not have been very new, but it was fine. The bathroom was also extremely clean, nothing flashy but perfectly adequate. There was also a nice roof terrace for sitting out - with the addition of some chairs and plants this could be an extremely pleasant place to lounge around for a while. Breakfast served in room also worked well. I would definitely stay here again. If you do decide to stay at this hotel, or indeed any other hotel in Karol Bagh, check out the nearby Ajmal Khan Park to see the local population enjoying all this small park has to offer. Jan 12 2008 comfortable n best stay ideally located,excellent service ,warm staff and i always make my customers stay there and all appreciate the hotel. Jan 5 2008 It is OK I chose this hotel after reading a few comments here. They were mostly right. This hotel is really OK nothing exciting but clean and the stuff was very friendly and helpful. It is situated right in the centre, which is good as well.It is a bit old-fashioned and you have a feeling that it looked good in 80's but it is a decent average hotel. No dining hall tho so you have to make sure you ask for your breakfast to delivered to your room!N.F., London Dec 9 2007 The Pits -- Stay Away Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this hotel. Stay far away. We were looking for a hotel in a good location with a reasonable price, but is an undervalued diamond. We often find such hotels on TripAdvisor, and we will continue to try, but this was definitely not one of them. If anything, it was worth much less than the $50 a night we paid. The rooms were not clean. We had to ask for towels. Three or four people hung around asking for tips. Three guys carried up two bags with their hands out the whole time. And then the security guy came up to show us how to use the air conditioning so he could solicit a tip. The bedcover was filthy and my wife slept on it with her clothes on. The smell of mothballs was everywhere. We left after one night and let them keep our prepaid second night. Yuck. Nov 24 2007 Old Fashioned But Not Bad for Price Warning - we booked online via a 3rd party site and were sold a &quot;room + breakfast&quot; option. Although you can order room service, they use a good local restaurant and don't have their own kitchen or dining room, nor do they offer any kind of &quot;included&quot; breakfast with the room. So don't trust any other Web site that tells you they do.The building is fairly old, the elevator tiny, the room old fashioned. I liked it as did my husband, but I can see that an American unused to travel outside new US hotels might be a little let down. It's no worse than many places I've stayed in NYC, Rome and elsewhere of the same vintage. It was certainly clean, and the location extremely convenient to the train station and local shopping.ABSOLUTELY Do contact the hotel directly for their airport pick-up service. They'll overcharge you (you pay about double what you would if you're a good bargainer with a taxi on site) but it's stioll not that much and well worth it if you've had a long flight and get in very late at night as so many Int'l flights do. Having the taxi there with our names on a posterboard made a big difference in the insane crowd of meeters and hawkers that assault you when you walk out of the arrivals lounge. Nov 15 2007 DISASTER! After reading positive reviews on this site, I've decided to book a 4 night stay at this hotel. What a mistake! It seems that there is no logical explanation for the good reviews, except... There is a big sign in the front lobby and in the elevator, saying &quot;Post a good review about us on tripadvisor.com and you can win 2 nights free stay&quot;. Yes, those who stayed there know what I'm talking about... I have personally seen 5 different rooms in the hotel, and they all were horrible. But, that will come later. Now, I'll talk about everything as it unfolded. Nobody waited for us at the airport, despite an arranged pickup. Fine, we go out, haggle our brains out with some taxi drivers, get imho a great deal (750 INR) for a nice AC car. We get to the hotel - they have no idea about our reservation. After lots of talking and etc, they say fine, we'll give you a room to freshen up, and then we'll see. We go up to the room. I have been in many places in the world, as work and a passion for travel takes me virtually everywhere. I have not seen a DISASTER like that anywhere in the world. Literally anywhere. The room is tiny. Dirty. Cramped. Smells like HELL. The bathroom is worse than a public toilet in a Moscow road underpass (or the subway for that matter). And it's really hard to beat a public toilet in a Moscow road underpass. I get upset and go downstairs to talk to the concierge. He says, that he doesn't really understand what my problem is. An Australian fellow overhears our conversation, and starts talking to me. Turns out to be my colleague, in town for the same reason as we are, with another colleague of his own. They've booked 2 rooms, arrived late at night, so they had no choice. They are shocked as well, despite this being far from their first visit to India. Together, we started looking for a new hotel. As we walk back upstairs, I see a cleanup operation in progress for one of the rooms (the door is open). 3 guys, with dirty rags, are busy smearing dirt around the room, instead of cleaning it. One guy, whacking the headboard of a bed (yes, whacking) with his dirty rag, will remain etched in my memory for a long time. Long story short, I got a second room. A higher end one. Yes, it was bigger than my co-worker's. Smelled a little better (still horrible). The washroom though - same story. Anyhow, we had to stay there for 2 nights, after which we moved to Sri Nanak Continental. Look it up, if you care to read my review about it. Bottom line - STAY AWAY from this place and from Channa Market in general. If you can, avoid Karol Bagh too. Not everyone can afford that, though. A couple of additional points: 1. One of our Indian colleagues went upstairs with us, on the night of our first day. He told us, that this hotel is considered to be ok/nice for an average middle class family in India. In other words, I guess it seems bad only to westerners. 2. I got to meet the owner of the hotel, on the second day. He felt genuinely chagrined by my unhappiness. He spent a while talking to me, gave us a duffel bag with the hotel logo as a gift (didn't really want to take it, but my colleague wanted it). He also forgave us some of the additional charges (water and etc). I mean it was for a laughable amount of 90 INR, but it's the effort that counts. Nov 15 2007 It's New Delhi Above average compared to other New Delhi moderately priced hotels. If possible, call direct to book--much cheaper. Everything worked; A/C, TV, fan, hot water. Asked for and received fresh towels when necessary. Tip everyone that helped you during your stay on the way out. Sep 17 2007 Bit of culture shock This was a good hotel (with air conditioning and a back up generator). Delhi can be quite a shock to the system but this was a nice oasis. The metro was very close and easy to use. The rooms were clean and the front desk staff spoke English. Mar 23 2007 Likely the best you'll find -- walk to shopping This is a decent hotel in the heart of the shopping district (walk 1/2 block from the hotel and you're on the main street). We stayed at this hotel for several days on two separate occassions and we did notice a big difference between the first floor and the third floor rooms -- third floor is much nicer and quieter. For the price, it's about the best you can find in Delhi, and the location is great for shopping. Also walking distance (about 3 blocks) to a GREAT restuarant -- Udupi (its clean, cheap, and great South Indian food!!). On the down side, the doormen were the lasiest I've seen anywhere, but the management seemed very nice.

Check-in is smooth. Sevice is good. Breakfast is always complimentary which is a plus. Sep 14 2009 Dont stay here cheap but definitely not cheerful..... We chose this hotel after hours of searching on the internet and reading in books as there is so much choice in Delhi, and we definitely made the wrong choice in many ways. We were only in Delhi for the night as we were flying out to Kathmandu the following morning, and this hotel served its purpose but thats as far as it went.Good - The location is pretty good for the centre of Delhi but is way too far away from the airport - The bedroom was a good size and contained 1 double bed and 1 single, along with a table and TVBad - The hotel offered a free pick-up from the airport but we couldnt manage to get through to them to arrange one. They refused to pay for our taxi when we arrived, and also refused to take us back to the airport the following morning to compensate - The room was very dingy even for night time - The room was very dirty and there were flies and even a cockroach in the bathroom - The area immeiately around the hotel was not very nice and you wouldnt want to venture out the hotel at nightOverallIt may be very hard to rate a hotel when you have been there less than 12 hours but this place is simply awful. It may be cheap compared to a lot of choices in Delhi, but there's a reason for that. Pay a little more and get a better place. Aug 5 2009 Hotel ok but... The hotel is ok as backpacker hotel. The staff is very nice and helpful. BUT be careful not to accept any extra service from this hotel. The hotel offered us to get a taxi for the airport and charged us RS 900 which is what you normally pay for renting the car for a whole day. A prepaid taxi will cost RS 250, Later we learned that the hotel had asked the driver to pay them the tip we had given him, and they told him that we had not payed for the trip in advance. That made us very angry and we shall never recommend this hotel to anyone. May 21 2009 QUICK SWITCH TO A FLEAPIT HOTEL This hotel did not honour our booking through Hotels.com on 17 – 20 April 2009. We were travelling with two children, one 3.5 and the other 18 months. We arrived in Delhi at 2 am in the morning of 18 April (the booking was for the night of 17 April). We caught a Delhi Traffic Police controlled prepaid taxi from the airport to the address provided with the booking receipt. The taxi driver could not find the address and took us at 3:30 am to a ‘tourist office’/ travel agent. The travel agent rang the hotel and my husband spoke to the hotel reception, who claimed that the hotel was full, and that we should make our way to the sister hotel – Hotel Ivory Palace in Karol Bagh, New Delhi. At this hour of the morning and with two children, we had no choice. The Hotel Ivory Palace can best be described as a flea pit. We subsequently found out through a travel agent that the room that we were provided was worth $29 AUD or about 1000 INR. We had paid for a super deluxe room (their premium room) with separate bed and a cot for the children at $67.00 AUD a night (2345 INR). We were provided with a room that had:· One bed for all four of us and when we complained an extra mattress was thrown on the floor· Unclean bedding· A hot water system that did not work and after repeated complaints it was fixed on the last day· Strong kerosene odour for the entire duration of our stay· No ‘premium bedding and pillows’· No clock radio· No coffee and tea making facilities· No complimentary newspapers· No housekeeping for all the days we were there· No in-room safe· No refrigerator· No rollaway bedsThe Hotel Ivory Palace was not close to Connaught Place or the railway station, which the Hotel Balaji purports to be. This was the reason I had chosen to book it. We tried phoning the Hotel Balaji Deluxe in the following days, but we could not get through on the number provided on the booking sheet. After unsuccessful attempts to get through to the hotel, we decided that it was a short stay and we should devote our energy to seeing Delhi and getting organised for the next part of our holiday. There was obviously a connection between the two hotels as the Hotel Ivory Palace was happy to take our booking sheet as proof of payment. Our feeling is that if the Hotel Balaji could not accommodate us, they should be obliged to provide an equivalent or superior standard of accommodation, as opposed to the significantly inferior option we were given. The only recompense we received after several complaints was that our room service breakfasts were covered by the hotel (Approx 450 INR). We feel extremely ripped off by the experience. I was trusting that Hotels.com is a reputable booking service and maybe we should have paid more attention to the review “DEN OF THIEVES – RUN FOR YOUR LIFE” on Trip Advisor, as they document the sort of contempt that the Hotel Balaji has for guests booking and prepaying over the internet. Apr 18 2009 Budget Hotel This hotel is one of the small hotels located in crammed up localities of Old Delhi.It is recommended if money and price are a issue for you. Mar 28 2009 It is worthy to go Good place, only several minutes from New Delhi railway station. Marble floor, the staff is nice, asked me for water several times, but finally charge me 50Rs, it's OK. The room is clean, and the hotel price is reasonable cheap! Dec 30 2008 Den of theives! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! We booked a suite thru expedia, selecting the hotel based on its free airport pick up advertised. We arrived at midnight, no one was there. We called and eventually we were met by their employee who got us a cab. Certainally we could have walked thru the doors &amp; got a fixed cab ourselves. The driver got lost. Eventually we arrived, gave our itinerary # and we given a small room. We said ours was a suite (2 adults, 1 kid) the clerk waved expedia papers he possed in our faces and said that was our room. No problem, we would get is sussed out in the morning, I was too tired to argue. We showed our papers in the am, the manager said the clerk had bad eyesite. We we upgraded to a slightly larger room. I overlooked the construction, painting in the lobby the luke warm hot water, the roach, filthy blankets I dare not use, all to check out....where the clerk insisted on paying for the lift from the airport. (2x the amount we would have paid if we got the taxi ourselves) I said it was included, and I paid for a suite for 2 nites &amp; only got one, lets call it even. No, he said. Expedia charged us too little, we should not have gotten what we paid for.After 1/2 hour and 2 failed called to expedia (disconnected) I paid as not to miss my connection. So I paid twice the amount for a room and 2x the amount for the taxi. ....and had a lousey stay. Back in Delhi staying at a much much better hotel for hte same cost. Avoid the Balaji unless you want to get riped off deluxe.\", doc_id='b741a42a-53dd-4c72-9943-1225287442cf', embedding=None, doc_hash='def1ce5227398739e82b24a2440d98f8e5af1fa38cec47fd4927dd5cb3493056', extra_info=None)], [Document(text='Love the Lobby the hotel is gr8 after renovation, need to gear up for the service standards............... Very comfortable I stayed in Lalit during my brief weekend trip to Delhi. I was positively surprised. Rooms were spacious and decorated with good taste, service was discreet and not too much. Suited well a Scandinavian traveller. We had a great stay here... Not a bad stay. Location is ok, not exactly in the middle of things, but it\\'s fine. We had a room on the 22nd floor overlooking the city which was nice. Our only complaint is that the reservation wasn\\'t ready when we got there and we had to wait for them to input in the computer again.Otherwise, the rooms were clean, the food service was excellent and we had a great view. The breakfast was good and had no real complaints. Nov 23 2009 Terrible experience I dont know where to start,it was a bad experience beginning with reservation till check out.I made reservation for two rooms and when I called they told me suite is 19000 per night.I said I would call later to confirm.Called 2 hours later and now they quote rate of 28,000 for same room.Asked that person to talk to manager and they agreed to give rate of 19000 per night.I gave them my credit card number and reservation was made.Then called them later to book another room they could not find my reservation adn had to rebook the room.This is terrible standard for 5 star reservations.Then food taste over there is terrible.We had a function and had 10 things on menu .Out of 10 prespeciifed things there were only 8 of them and all of them tasted terrible.Then come to check out process,the staff has such an attitude - even the person who comes and get your luggage.We conveyed all these things to hotel manager at the end.He made some concessions for our bad experiences.But overall it was terrible stay,there are many 5 star hotels in same area with much better service. Nov 23 2009 hotel is gorgeous but service lashit I stayed here for four nights in November 2009, and am so disappointed that despite the facelift since last year, the service is still the same: slow, unfriendly and depressing. There is a real problem in this hotel with the staff and customer service compared to any other 5 star hotel. The Taj puts the Lalit to shame, mind you so would the travel lodge. Let\\'s start with the pick up service at the airport. It was complimentary. Great. He nearly went without me though! Two names on the same board. Because it had been booked by the same tour company, the driver assumed that when the first person arrived, they could go without me.. It was the other lady who saved the day by asking the driver to wait behind for me, otherwise they would have gone. Thanks to this lady! Secondly, on check in. 45 minutes this process took. I had requested a &quot;quiet, non-smoking room&quot; and called that day to confirm this request. They didn\\'t have it!! Eventually after much negotiation they had a room, but when I got there, it was facing the train station, and had no bath. So I called up, and they showed me two other rooms with another compromise: one was smoking, one was adjoining room. I went with the &quot;quiet adjoining&quot; - my god bad choice. The hotel might have been refurbished, but the soundproofing at this place is dire. The next door neighbours could be heard rustling their newspapers and stirring their coffee - no joke! It was awful. Also, they decided to start smoking in a non-smoking room as the smoke smell went right under the door and stank my room out. I called front desk to report this, but who knows if they done anything! Laundry service is late. My trousers were 1.5 hours late. Breakfast was nice but again bad service, I was made to sit down at a dirty table, no one cleaned it. Upon check out, they had preauthorised the charges to another guest\\'s credit card, and no one asked me how was my stay. They dont have questionnaires in the room and its no wonder, they know about the hotel\\'s problems I am sure they must get lots of complaints. PS rooms are nice but not functional. Trying to figure out the shower, the button is hidden behind the dial. I wont stay here on my next trip to India. Nov 23 2009 Pricey but Beautiful I stayed in a new room at The Lalit and thought it was amazing. The service, food, salon, gym, pool, decor, etc. can only be considered five-star, but it definitely came at a high price. Nov 15 2009 Cordial comfort and convenience The impressive entrance and reception area makes an immediate impact. There are several very comfortable seating areas where you can wait for people, or just watch the world go by. It is a busy hotel, and I suspect that quite a few business people use it as it is close to the business area of Delhi. We liked the position of the hotel ( it is about 10 minutes away from Connaught Place), and the larger than average rooms. We asked for a non-smoking room as close to the top of the hotel as possible, and we weren\\'t disappointed with the fabulous view. The air conditioning worked well and was easy to control. The bed was extra king size, incredibly comfortable with a light duvet. I would have appreciated a sheet under the duvet - sometimes you don\\'t want to sleep with a duvet, but you still need a light cover. Both the bed linen and towels were top quality. We had to ask for extra towels, and one light in the bathroom wasn\\'t working, but it was sorted out pretty quickly once we called reception. The flat screen TV showed all the usual channels, including BBC 24. As I am not a breakfast person I really appreciated the tea making facilities in the room, and also the amount of (free) bottled water. The bathroom was spacious, with a huge walk in shower. Curiously, the bathroom was separated from the main room by a see through glass wall - but you could roll down the fitted blinds if you wanted some privacy. The restaurant on the ground floor is open 24 hours - and we were grateful to be able to order food and something to drink when we arrived at the hotel at 1.30 in the morning. I didn\\'t like having to pay to use the internet in the business centre (if you had your own laptop the wifi was free). But I did like the fact that we were given a late check out and so could take our time before leaving for a late flight out. The pool area was good, hardly used it seemed to us (but we were there in the low season) and the changing room facilities were fine, although the ladies changing rooms could have been better stocked with shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. The service in the restaurant was a bit hit and miss - sometimes very quick, other times we had to wait for ages. Security at the entrance of the hotel was good - fast but thorough. Nov 14 2009 I would live here all the time if I could! I stayed in the Lalit for a week in September, and am planning to go back there again for a couple of days next week. I travel to- and around- India a lot with my work, and the Lalit is by far the best hotel that i have stayed in in Delhi, and also in India (even better than the Taj Bengal, Hyatt etc). There were a few issues during my stay, but the hotel manager went out of his way to resolve these for me, going over and above what I would expect. The rooms are spacious, modern and a joy to work in, as was the gym. Ah! The gym, the pool and the spa.. I would be happy just living here, in fact. The gym has powerplates, all the latest equipment, a great view, and the staff are extremely helpful. food = great, and a wide selection for room service. Definitely go for the buffet breakfast if you can. Nov 14 2009 Excellent Hotel-Good location.Value for money. We enjoyed our stay in the Hotel.Centre of Delhi,Cannaugt place ,was walking distance from Hotel.My daughter enjoyed the pool.The room was big with all modern amenities.The breakfast was lavish.All the staff we interacted with were very courteous.Overall an exceiient Hotel. Nov 13 2009 SNOTTY RECEPTION STAFF The attitude displayed by the reception staff towards me was appalling. I had been looking forward to experiencing this hotel but because I choose not to have a credit card on my person (I have a debit card instead), the reception staff forced me to leave all my cash (Rs5000) with them as a deposit:: I felt quite insulted . In the rest of my travels in throughout India staying at other 5-star hotels, I never once experienced this problem again. The room was modern but the bathroom lighting didn\\'t work. The food was adequate. Nov 12 2009 The Lalit 5 star. Service was excellent, arrived at 1 :00 am and my credit card was refused but they still let me go to the room.The room was modern with really good fittings, superb bathroom.Reasonably well located, a short taxi or tuk tuk ride to Connaught Place and many other attractions. The restraunt for breakfast was great, the outside eating area was clen and welcoming if a bit noisy from road traffic.All in all a good quality 5 star hotel with attentive and helpful staff. Nov 7 2009 Lalit Very Comfortable, big rooms, beautiful lights and entertainment...helpful friendly stuff. Everything was Excellent ! Nov 4 2009 NOT THE BEST - BE SURE TO REQUEST A NEW ROOM AND DONT EAT THE FOOD I stayed at the Lalit in Oct 09. On arrival check in was quick and i was asked if i had stayed with them before. IF you are asked this question say YES otherwise the will give you one of the older rooms yet to be refurbished. I moved rooms as not only was it old, dated and noisy dues to the nearby train station and the constant train horns but the wireless internet is so slow you cannot even access email.The new rooms are very comfortable and modern and the wired internet is fine. Still noisy depending on what side of the hotel you are on. I ate in the hotel each night and mostly the food was fine. The Grill is expensive and service is VERY slow but the food was acceptable. The Chinese resturant is OK. The bistro in the lobby is expensive and the buffet curry\\'s are nothing special. They do however carry a mild case of Salmonella which is an unpleasant way to finish a trip!Check your bill carefully. I booked a room with free internet and they tried to charge me twice. Also check the dates on cans from the mini bar. In both my rooms they were over a year out of date.Over all and acceptable hotel with good fitness facilities and good location. If you can get over the noise of the trains and don\\'t get poisoned its fine. Nov 2 2009 Make sure you request a new room I arrived with a colleague and we checked in together. Her room was amazing, modern, and clearly worth the 5 star rating. Mine was old fashioned, had a bathroom with old fittings and rust stains, and smelled of stale smoke (room 1512). When I asked to change room due to the smell they told me the hotel was fully booked and they would move me in the morning but in the meantime would arrange for my room to be aired. Nothing happens quickly in this hotel but 45 min later a man finally turned up to help. Eventually we agreed there was nothing that could make the room smell better so I was moved to a room which miraculously became available.Overall the hotel fixtures and fittings were nice but, while staff were keen to meet every need, it could take hours (and several reminders) for them to actually do anything. The breakfast and other food was ok but nothing special and on one day we sat for half an hour at a table where we\\'d had to clear dirty dishes to one end (there were no clean ones available) and did not manage to see a single waiter to ask for a coffee. Oct 31 2009 Good 5-star hotel with a classy touch Hotel must have been renovated recently. They kept some of the &quot;old&quot; features but at the same time put it up to international 5-star standards. Well done. Oct 28 2009 would not stay again... We only had one night in the Lalit, and chose it because it was closer to the railway as we were travelling, by train, to Agra the next day. Our flight from Varanasi was delayed..so we did not arrive at the hotel until 7 30 pm. Our booked room was not ready...and we had to wait!!! The girl typed and typed and typed into her computer..no apologies no reason and so annoying!! When we finally made it to the room..the room was clean and fresh. There was a sign to request fresh fruit if required. As our next morning was to be really early..I thought...good idea. Tried to ring in house dining. Phone didn\\'t work. Went down stairs and requested at the front desk. You guessed it...never arrived. We had a drink in the downstairs bar and ate in the restaurant. All fine, not exceptional and definitely zero warm and fuzzy customer service, and quite expensive. To be fair in one way, the Lalit were finalising what looked like a massive renoavation BUT their prices definitely do not reflect any leeway for that...so they need to be judged against the full price tarriff. Would not stay again. Would head back to the Taj Oct 26 2009 Comfortable if somewhat characterless The Lalit is extremely comfortable, well appointed and well run. The location is handy for Connaught Place. Our standard room was spacious, clean and comfortable. In fact, everything you would expect from an international class hotel.It suffers only for being a large international hotel, in feeling a little anonymous and impersonal, which is only a minor complaint.If you can secure a reasonable rate via one of the hotel web sites, this is a good place to stay. Watch out for early check-in charges, though. Oct 21 2009 The worst hotel that I have exeperienced in my 10 travelling years As expatriates for years, we have travelled to many countries and lived in various hotels for business or leisure purposes. Here is a summary of our 3 days stayed at this hotel. Upon our arrival, we discovered that our confirmed reservation was not listed in the hotel. We understand sometimes things are not in pleasant way and thus be patience for the front office staff to check. Sadly, the staff took ages to check our booking and promised to come back to us after his investigation. To our utterly dismay and shock, the staff didn\\'t check with the booking agent and thus created another havoc during our check out. We believe, an unprofessional behaviour indeed does not reflect positively on a 5 star rating hotel. Space is limited, and we can\\'t continue with more words. You are more than welcome to contact us for more details. Oct 16 2009 A diamond in the rough The Lalit remains one of the most lavish hotels in which I have every stayed. Everything in the hotel is modern, stylish and sparkling clean. There is a small night club/bar inside the hotel as well as a restaurant. Make sure to try the breakfast buffet, it is awesome! Oct 3 2009 Pretty Decent and a Good value Lalit is within walking distance of Connaught Place. Very nice rooms, good staff. I liked the gym as very few people used it and it had new equipment. Coffee shop is OK, but breakfast buffet is not as grand as the Taj or Radisson, but still good. Make sure you grab the waiter\\'s attention if you require coffee immediately. For some strange reason, they haven\\'t figured out the caffeine needs of the Western traveler. I really liked their wired internet. High speed, secure and no hassle logging on. Would stay here again. Paid @ $140 a night. Sep 28 2009 Very nice hotel walking distance to Connaught Place Very nice hotel with helpful staff and walking distance to Connaught Place Sep 20 2009 Our home away from home for seven nights We loved this hotel. It was our home for a total of 7 nights during our 3 week trip to India this summer. The security is very impressive. We felt very safe and secure in a city which is pretty crazy at times. A full breakfast was included. We had most meals in the 24/7 resturant located on the first floor. Desk people were beautifully dressed and very helpful. Room service was immediate. They even knew our names. All issues were addressed promptly. The pool area is breathtaking. Lounge chairs rest in the water. Service was very impressive. We all had our hair cut and other services of the spa which were first rate. The shop owners in the hotel were especially nice. We bought sari\\'s and beautiful scarves from Kashmiri Arts located on the second floor. We stayed at many hotel during our stay which were nice but the Lalit is in a class all its own. Sep 19 2009 Impressive !! Hotel Lalit has beautiful new rooms. Myself and my clients were impressed with the service. Mr Ravindra Kumar, F&amp;B Manager has been very courteous and always make sure that clients go back satisfied and come back to Lalit for their next trip to India. I always impressed with Ravindra. He has been sending regular mails to remind us the interesting events, gala dinners held in The Lalit.. What a great way to be in touch with the clients in various countries..As promised with Ravindra Kumar I recommended my clients to stay for 15 room nights in month of September 2009. Yesterday I got the feedback from the client that service was impressive and Ravindra and other staff of hotel took good care. All my Japanese clients felt like home.. Thank you Lalit and thank you Ravindra.. Sep 16 2009 Beautiful hotel I stayed at the Lalit with my partner during our recent visit to India. The hotel is impressive with high ceiling and modern furishings. Nice facilities especially the swimming pool and gym is equipped with new and good machines. The room is clean and comfortable. The staff are polite. Many nice restaurants in the hotel, breakfast is good with wide spread of food, I had dinner at Wok however food is not up to expectation should be improved with its presentation and taste. Excellent location just minutes away to the famous bengali market. Sep 15 2009 Overall satisfactory but some minor problems We stayed three nights at the Lalit. I had a mixed experience with them during our stay. We had some minor issues besides that everything went well. We had booked through a travel agent and got a good rate for the room inclusive of breakfast.The location of this hotel is really good five minutes from railway station and Connaught Place. It was convenient as shopping and loads of restaurants were around the corner. Taxi charged Rs. 50 and auto rickshaw charged Rs. 20 to go to CP. Taxis were available at all times and rickshaw could be hired from outside the hotel.The lobby is breathtaking with a nice waterfall, huge paintings and pianist, everything in the lobby is spanking brand new. Our room was on the 19th floor with a great view but the room was really old and it was especially visible in the bathroom with old taps, rickety shower, watermarks and chips in the wash basin. We had problems with air conditioning making noises and that got fixed and one day cable went off as well but was fixed promptly. These are very minor issues but for a five star should have been fixed beforehand and it makes a difference between a good and great stay.The breakfast was really good; it was buffet style with both Indian and American options. There are tons of different items and baked goods as well. The food was prepared fresh and had several cooking stations.The attitude of the staff was great and were always willing to help with a smile. Wifi is available for Rs 200 for 30 minutes. I signed up for this twice and used it for about 10 minutes each, but upon checkout they billed for Rupees 850 stating that I used the internet for an hour each but could not explain the charges as I had only signed up for the half an hour option. I was not going to argue over $10 as they said have to check with the IT to find out the problem.We were a bit let down with some little issues, these things are not expected of a hotel trying to compete with Taj or Oberoi. Overall we had a satisfactory stay at the Lalit and will probably stay again because of its great location. Sep 10 2009 Fantastic Hotel On a recent stay I found the Lalit to be a great hotel to stay at in New Delhi. Very modern with a beutiful lobby, great rooms, great restraunts/bar &amp; a lovely pool area. Staff were always very friendly &amp; helpful and the bed was soo comfortable!Pool area very nice with lots of lounges to choose, my only gripe that no alcohol would be served by the pool, so much for my cocktail &amp; a swim! Was about 4 blocks walking distance to shops/market or a few minutes tuk tuk ride for about 40 rupees. Price of food at hotel felt a little over the top for India, though it was beautiful food, the buffet to die for &amp; it should be expected at a 5 star hotel.This hotel deserves it 5 stars, I would stay again, it was a great choice Sep 9 2009 A more intimate 5 star business hotel Usually stay in The Park or the Imperial but booked into this place for a change. Good gym, small but perfectly formed, with new machines. Bar not too uber trendy or pretentious. Good standard/choice of food on the buffet/a la carte. What I really liked was the feeling that this hotel was not just another huge, anonymous 5 star hotel that you can rattle around in (although it did have approx 500 rooms!). Will definitely use again. Sep 3 2009 Good service good value for Delhi Have stayed at the Lalit three times now.The continued updating of the building is good. The pool and terrace were available on this trip and are very nice. A small oasis of calm in the middle of Delhi. Only downside is the piped music can get on your nerves.Staff are friendly and the service is good. Room service food and restaurant a\\'la Carte menu is always a joy.When we first stayed there it had the largest range in a breakfast buffet I\\'ve ever seen. Unfortunately it seems to be getting smaller and relies more on processed and pre-packed products. This might be a minor point but it was an attraction on earlier visits. It is possibly seasonal.WiFi/Internet price is high. Business centre printing prices are extortionate. Aug 28 2009 Absolutely delightful I really liked the property. Location is excellent and the hotel is 5 star delux i would say. At the bargain i got it was a steal. The rooms are classy and they upgraded me to their superior room on my request at the reception. Further even a late check out was given .Reception was good and very helpful. Aug 17 2009 Nice Hotel good room This is a nice hotel in the heart of new delhi. I was traveling with my friends. We had a nice rooms.The hotel was helpful with helping us to get information about newdelhi, recommending and booking nice restaurants.But the cups and kettle in the room verey dirty they dont wash it well take care ,,see and wash them good befor you use them.Bathroom verey cute but there is problem in shower basin water is stuck ..Internet verey expensive.. Jul 27 2009 Excellent place Well the rooms were extremely good,staff nice,the 24x7coffee shop great,choice of breakfast was the best I ever had in india.In short...excellent hotel.. Jul 21 2009 The Best Hotel I Have Stayed At I initially planned on staying at the Lalit for only a few days in February before moving on to another place, but had such a good experience that I ended up staying here until my trip ended in June.What made my experience memorable was the kind of service that my family and I received. I fell ill on my 2nd or 3rd day and when one of the housekeepers learned of this, he asked if I needed any medical assistance. We told him that I would be fine, and thanked him. Later that evening, I received a phone call from somebody--front desk, I believe--asking how I was feeling. The next morning a manager asked me how I was doing and connected me with a doctor, who prescribed medication for me. Receiving that sort of attention says a lot about their level of service, and it continued after I extended my stay. Everyone from the bottom to the top—from porters, waiters, and housekeeping to upper management--treated us like we were VIPs. As for the hotel, itself...Just as other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is beautiful and decorated in a contemporary style.The standard rooms are comfortable and of a good size. I liked the furniture and decor. The hardwood floors are a nice touch and also function well in keeping the room cool. After a long, hot day, I would love to return to my room and turn on the large flat-panel TV while sitting on the comfy bed. Although there are plenty of dining options outside of the hotel, the 24/7 &quot;coffee shop&quot; located on the lobby level served all our needs and we rarely bothered eating out. It is run very well, and the service was excellent during my stay. The wait staff was attentive and always very friendly and the chefs, themselves, would often drop by to ask how the food was, eager for feedback. The breakfast buffet is very nice--it\\'s possible that the selection may vary depending on whether or not it\\'s tourist season, but regardless they offer both continental and Indian fare. The bakery next to the 24/7 coffee shop is also nice.There are other restaurants in the hotel, and I must say that the Baluchi restaurant is great. The food is good, and 6 days a week there is live music performed at night. I would sometimes just go there to listen to the ghazals before turning in for the night.The fitness center, which is open 24 hours a day is good, and quite exceptional for a hotel--free weights, machines (including a Smith machine), treadmills and bikes as well as a small yoga/stretching room. Next to the fitness center is the spa and the lovely swimming pool, which opened at the beginning of March.The location is excellent. It is not very far from any of the tourist destinations. In fact, we could see two historic landmarks (India Gate and Humayun\\'s Tomb) from our hotel room window. It is within walking distance of the main Connaught Place circus and a few other markets--the main Connaught Place center, as well as the smaller Bengali and Shankar markets. It is also very close to a metro station. All of these are 5-10 minute walks from the hotel, though there are also plenty of auto rickshaws outside the hotel grounds and along the way if you prefer not to walk.Overall, this hotel has a lot going for it. I had a great experience, and although I had never heard of the Lalit hotel chain prior to my visit, I would most certainly wish to stay there again if I return to Delhi. Jul 14 2009 Beautiful Hotel Exceptional Service Great Food I stayed at the Lalit for a week while in Delhi this past spring and would HIGHLY recommend it to any travelers visiting the city. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff was phenomenal. Overall, it was without a doubt one of the best hotel experiences I\\'ve had to date. -StaffThe Lalit\\'s staff is perhaps what sets it apart from other hotels, in that they seem to go above and beyond to be hospitable to the hotel\\'s guests. Everyone was extremely friendly and always willing to go out of his/her way to ensure that we were properly taken care of during our stay (especially the wait staff at the 24/7 restaurant downstairs).-RoomsAs far as comfort goes, the Lalit\\'s rooms are what you would expect from any really nice hotel in the US or Europe. What I think set it apart from others was the level of cleanliness (immaculate!) in the room. Also, the room we stayed in was beautifully furnished with modern decor, making it very pleasing from an aesthetic standpoint as well. -LocationThe hotel is located very centrally, in Delhi\\'s Connaught Place district. This was great as we were close to many of the main tourist attractions (Humayun\\'s Tomb, India Gate, etc.), and certainly not far from the others. Given the traffic situation in Delhi, this proved to be very advantageous throughout the trip.-DiningThere are at least two or three restaurants housed in the hotel, however I never ventured beyond its main &quot;24/7 Cafe&quot;, where I ate at least two meals each day. The menu is reasonably-priced and very extensive, offering American, Italian, Japanese, and of course, Indian dishes. Perhaps the best part of the restaurant (aside from the fact that it is open at all hours) was the daily breakfast buffet, which offered a wide variety of fresh fruits, cheeses, pastries, cereals, eggs/omlettes, and much, much more.-Fitness Center/SpaAlso worth noting is the Lalit\\'s exceptional fitness center, which offers a number of exercise options and wonderful equipment (free weights, weight machines, ellipticals, treadmills). Additionally, they also offer kickboxing classes, as well as yoga. There is also a spa attached, though I did not make use of it.-PoolJust outside the fitness center is a gorgeous outdoor pool, where you can even order food and beverages to snack on while relaxing by the water. Jul 10 2009 Pleasant...the best beds this side of delhi The best bit about the hotel is that even though its in Connaught Place, its still removed enough from the madness. Its all but 10 minutes of walking to CP inner circle and janpath and similar to the metro station. Ideal for the business traveller as much of the Cp business district is like next door.Also refreshing was the room (though the touch up work was little sketchy at places - leaving much to desire) but the rain head shower, the bath tub, the clear class partition between the room and the washroom...was clam and simple.The minibar left much a lot much to desire, i mean 4 cans of soda and two bottles of water, please gimme sm more. The most comfortable bit about my room 2103 was the beds...the best beds i have slept in the mattress was divine to say the least soft but just the right amount, and the pillows again really nice...i had one of the most comfortable night caps ever in a hotel.I tried just a bit of the breakfast and whatever i had was nice...There was some wall patchwork done which was really visible on the bedside, and sm of the woodwork needed a new varnish but it was still a really nice stay. Oh just one more thing maybe maybe they could have a few more ppl at the front desk i, waited a good 15 minutes before the three could maybe tend to my checkout (which was performed by smone other than the actual front desk staff). Jun 22 2009 Excellent 5 Star hotel Really first cladd hotel, or both business and pleasure, Spotlessly clean, excelent service. The outdoor pool is perfect. Food is good - especially the choice at buffet breakast (so make sure its included in your rate) - fresh fruit, omelettes/eggs cooked to order, Japanese - and of course Indian (so if you\\'e new to India, this is a safe intro to the joys of dosas, vadi, bhajis, uppam etc!). The Spa is World class too - but priced accordingly (ie its not cheap).The newly renovated rooms on the upper floors have everythig you could ever need - great bathrooms, massive flat screen TV etc.Tip: use black &amp; yellow taxi\\'s to get around (negotiate fixed price) - the Lalits own car may be air-con - but its also at least 5 times as expensive. Jun 22 2009 Need to train their support staff The stay was comfortable, and few support functions were good. I was in Delhi on a business trip and hence did not spend much time in the room though. Had to check in and out more than a couple of times due to my work schedule. Got different rooms each time and therefore was able to experience variety. At the reception, not always is the best room allotted even if requested for. Some support staff are terrible and need severe training. One of the managers at the reception was very helpful, even when the credit card system was not operational. Overall a good experience, but need to put their act together given their positioning. Jun 18 2009 Lalit well situated but.... My friend and I stayed here for 4 days in late November. The Lalit was formerly the Intercontinental; it was taken over by Indian hotel magnate Lalit Suri. We had booked our reservation at the Intercon so were surprised to see the Lalit sign and flags in front - we thought the cab driver dropped us at the wrong hotel! It just so happened that we arrived on the day the new name was unveiled.The entrance to the hotel is almost right off the street, so no grounds to speak of. The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated with modern flair and some enormous paintings of the Suri family. Check in was smooth, although the staff were not especially pleasant. The hotel has several elevators, but it always seems to be a long wait to catch one.Rooms are modern and well appointed. We stayed in a standard room with 2 double beds - it was a little cramped, but comfortable and clean. The hotel has a very cosmopolitan feel, with travelers from many different countries. We met people from Africa, China, Europe and Australia and the US. It is situated about a 15 min walk to Connaught Place and within short driving distance to many historical and modern attractions. There are some great restaurants and bars serving international fare in Connaught Place - ask the concierge at the hotel to make reservations for you.Our biggest complaint was dining at the Lalit. There is a buffet restaurant to the right of the main lobby, but there wasn\\'t much variety nor was the food very good. We had to wait a long time for a server to take our drink orders, and dishes were not cleared away in a timely manner so ended up crowding our table. There is also a pastry shop that at that time did not sell coffee or small pastries that you could grab on the run. The 24/7 Bar only served food/snacks while the buffet restaurant was open, and it was the same stuff as served in the buffet.We also tried to eat at Woks because we had heard some good things about it, but after waiting 2 hours were still not seated. It got so late we just got take out and took it back to our room. After all that, the food was disappointing - greasy and tasteless. Needless to say, after that we just ate off site.Overall - nice, well kept hotel, well situated. Service was passable. Just find other places to eat. Jun 17 2009 Excellent Hotel in Convenient Part of City Great large Rooms and ovesized modern bathrooms. Nice views as well. Ate at two of the hotel restuarants, WOK on the top floor surpassed expectations with excellent food, though slow service. The cafe on the 3rd floor was mediocre at best. Service was excellent throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend the hotel for both business and leisure. Jun 13 2009 Business friendly hotel Good business hotel, right in the heart of delhi.situated in the CBD of CP/Barakhamba road and very close to Barakhamba metro station, this hotel smacks of business opulence. I stayed here for almost three months and became and gold member of priority club.The deals are normally around 10k INR per night though it might rise upto 15k in the busy season.it has one of the two heated swimming pools in all of delhi.Okish restaurents but the coffee shop has a lavish spread for breakfast. The best thing about this was the quality of the rooms - lots of gadgets, transparent glasses for bathroom walls and clean look to the entire place.I recommend this. Jun 7 2009 Loved the Bathroom I stayed in the hotel in the month of April \\'09. The hotel is magnificent and I have just loved the bathroom which has a glass wall. It is so lovely that it was hard to drag myself away from the bath to the room. It was so hot and busy there, I couldn\\'t wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the bath. I was expecting a few nibbles but breakfast is a lovely continental spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc. Quite difficult to fit in any meals out after all that! The hotel lobby is splendid with very good decor &amp; ambience. 3 things I would like the hotel to look into:- The interiors of the rooms need to be done up. In my room the walls hd some cracks &amp; patchwork of painitngs were clearly visible which does not shw the hotel in the right perspective.- The other thing I would like to highlight is that the hotel still does not have a loyalty program &amp; no tie ups with any airlines. This is a little bizarre consideing the tough competition that the industry is in.- Airport pickups &amp; drops are charged......this is something weird I found!! In my view one of the journeys could be charged, but not both!! BUT overall I would say this is probably the best hotel I have stayed in off late. Perhaps not the most convenient if you have business in Gurgaon!! But if you want to mix of good food, service with the odd trip to connaught place then this is an absolute must!!Do pay heed to my suggestions....Lalit will definitely go a long way in fulfilling Mr. Lalit Suri\\'s dreams!! Jun 4 2009 Great service I was at The Lalit during a period of 2nights. I visited Delhi for business purpose and decided to be put up at The Lalit. My decision was wise as the service rendered was very pleasing.The staff was extremely courteous. The food was authentic and delicious. I was extremely happy with their service &amp; I shall always recommend The Lalit to everybody. Jun 3 2009 Best for Business events - Stay is calm- Staff very good- Excellent place for business events- Food, excellent and having real taste of India- Location: in middle of Delhi- Airport is just 30 to 40 minutes away. Jun 3 2009 nice stay Much more than expected. I went Delhi to attend a national meeting. My company opted me to stay at hotel lalit. The ambience of hotel is very gud. Service is very fast and courteous.I liked the food and dining of this hotel very much. Jun 2 2009 Great new location old refurnished classy hotel the Lalit is the newer version of the Old Intercontinental hotel which used to be there. taken over by a new management, this hotel is very much up to the mark.great place to be, an absolute 5 star...ciaoronak Jun 2 2009 Advantage Location This hotel is in heart of Delhi and is the best in terms of location and logistics.The food in all the returants at this place is fingerlicking good.The rooms are sufficently large with spacious washrooms.The gym and the spa at this place is really good.Overall this is a good hotel in the heart of Delhi May 22 2009 Looks good but too many niggles ... February 2009 saw my first stay at the renovated Lalit after several stays there in the \\'old days\\'. On arrival the hotel looks very impressive but it didn\\'t really live up to expectations due to a number of small problems. Check in was very slow and complicated which was very frustrating as we arrived at 10:30pm. I was travelling with an Indian colleague and we both had to endure a lengthy (and unnecessary) form filling exercise which apparently is part of their procedures. Although the hotel has been renovated the old lifts remain which are rather slow and one of my pet hates. The rooms have been very well decorated with comfortable beds and a huge flat screen television. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the proximity to the railway station can make for a rather noisy night. Although very busy I have to say that breakfast is superb with an enormous array of food to cater for all tastes and dietary requirements. Another problem came on check out where I was significantly UNDERCHARGED on my bill and had to wait until it was corrected. Overall you will be comfortable and well looked after at the Lalit, they just need to work a bit harder on some of the smaller things, particularly at reception. May 21 2009 Grand ..... I thought the hotel was stunning .... i can see on the site that people had poor service well that was not experience ... there was a missing bathrobe in my room one day which I needed to go the swimming I had one in less than 5mn upon request.I used all the services the gym , the spa, the swimming pool, the traditional Indian restaurant everything was a delight.... Considering it was 43C when I visited the hotel was a peaceful and refreshing haven from the bustle and heat from the city May 20 2009 Not really a good hotel to stay I found their services to be very poor and staff reluctant to entertain the guests. The locker in the room was not working and at reception I asked them to keep my passport. They retorted by telling me that I should keep the passport in locker in the room. When I told them locker is not working, they said sorry but they can\\'t keep. They didn\\'t either change the room or got the locker repaired.This hotel is near by a railway station and it was difficult to sleep with trains hooting away whole night. May 10 2009 Perfect Business Spot It is the perfect Business hotel in the heart of the city. The hotel has a great SPA which you should visit and use the facility. The resturant has a big spread of menu and food is average. Lot of place to hang around near by and shopping too. May 6 2009 Loved the new decor of hotel Visited this hotel on a business visit and was very pleased with the arrangements. The hotel is just renovated and it’s a great atmosphere to mix business with pleasures in that hotel. Rooms are very good and I enjoyed the stay. The only problem here is the STAFF not friendly, the room service takes a lot of time and most of the time the staff is too confused if you ask them anything, they are a bit rude a bit attitude problem I can say. Overall well equipped, good food, great bar a perfect place for business if they have a better staff. May 2 2009 love 24/7 i like the overall experience ...and moreover i visit 24/7 very frequently ..im in love with it totally...coz you get liquor there 24/7 ..name suggests all ... May 1 2009 Good Hotel for a Business Traveller A good-quality business hotel in a convenient location with excellent dining options. Apr 29 2009 Hate the place This was a crazy stay. Was booked for two nights with my family, but it was possibly the worst stay ever.Checkin etc was smooth, but the first evening, the air conditioner for the entire hotel went off. There was some scheduled maintenance going on and was supposed to go on for a couple of hours initially, but it went on till the next afternoon.In Delhi\\'s heat, this five star hotel gave us a torrid time. The staff ran out of fans and we could not even open our window.The staff did not help much. I ended up arguing with them regarding the fare they were charging me. They had the gall to present me with a full bill on check out. It made me furious.Terrible, terrible, terrible.One positive thing about the hotel is it\\'s good location. If you are willing to walk a few steps, CP is almost next door. Apr 28 2009 Better After Renovation The Lalit has come up with a New Look after Renovation , The Rooms are Much better and location as usual is good Close to many of the offices. The Restaurant is also very nice Apr 25 2009 Great Experience In totality it was a great experience. Food, stay was really satisfying and to add to that, slept really well after a really long work schedules. Service at the restaurant was good. The Hotel was very secure too. Apr 25 2009 Great place Stayed in the presidential suite for 1 night due to unavailability of space. Rate of 400 USD per night, did not matter since my client was paying! It was one of the best experiences of my life. The complementary wine, the jacuzzi and the rest of the services were first class. The brekfast was excellent as well. The decor was fantastic and the location of the hotel is perfect for access to central New Delhi. Recommended for anyone wanted to stay in an upmarket place Apr 20 2009 Dont touch the mini bar! Goes without saying I suppose, but tired and frazzled after a days travel the thought of a reviving G&amp;T is irresistble until you clock the prices in this hotel . R900for a gin or other spirit then add tax on top. They know how to charge here. Also beware of the buffet, average though it is, costs R1770. You expect excellent service at this price, but it took over an hour before I could get into my room as the wrong key card was issued 3 times. Apr 17 2009 intercontinental touch is missing... While, I had been going in this hotel for a while, this was part of the priority club and now probably independent and named as Lalit. The intercontinental touch is gone, the service level has gone down and I found the people to be more aloof than before. Their breakfast used to be one of the very best and very exhaustive. They were able to amintain that so far, however I see people are little disoriented now. The maintanance of their gym and swimming pool is also going poor now. Apr 17 2009 Lalit good value for money The Lalit has been through a major overhaul and the renovated rooms are well appointed with large flat TVs, glass walled bath and shower area and a huge glass window to give a view of the city.Elevators are still being upgraded to the wait is sometimes longer.Food was not upto the standards of the old hotel (Intercontinental). Breakfast was boring with only one fresh juice and one canned juice option. Usual eggs and sausage (no smoked salmon) and Indian parathas and dosas etc.The mini bar has flavoured water for Rs 175/- which is a total rip off. The hotel only gives you 2 small bottles of water per day which is not adequate.Staff is a bit uncertain at times, check out took a long time.All in all a good hotel at a modest price in New Delhi\\'s Connaught Place area. Apr 16 2009 Very good hotel - would recommend it. Just back from a 4 night stay at The Lalit. Very impressed with the hotel - pick up from airport and check in were very smooth and quick and staff were all very friendly and eager to help. Really good location - very easy to get a taxi/auto rickshaw or even walk up to Connaught Place. The doormen were always ready to get you a taxi and not push the hotel cars.We had two double rooms on the 21st floor and, although you could see the railway line from one room, the noise from the trains was very distant and did not bother us at all. The rooms were very well equipped - the only thing lacking was the usual hotel guide, although there was a room service menu. The bathroom was very nice, but the mini bar was very sparsely stocked - only things in the fridge were one can each of coke and fanta!! (although they did provide 4 bottles of water every day). Breakfast was very good and we ate at the 24/7 lobby restaurant one night which was very nice, although the continual repeating chillout music got on your nerves after a while.My daughters really enjoyed the pool area - in particular the lovely lounging chairs on the edge of the pool and my eldest and myself used the spa and thoroughly enjoyed it - very reasonably priced, too. Wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay there again if in New Delhi. Had a really nice short break on the whole and we were not harrassed half as much as we expected even though my 18 yr old has long blonde hair and attracted lots of \\'friendly stares\\' and lots of requests for photographs! Apr 10 2009 great breakfast spacious clean room too much noise from trains excellent hotel in terms of cleanliness, service, quality of food (especially at breakfast) and safe. However, too close to train station, so lots of noise all night and day. Good location though. Apr 6 2009 NAIL IN THE MAIN BED..GOT HURT DR IN HOTEL GAVE AN ANTI TITANUS INJECTION nail in the frame of the main bed which hurt me in the leg..a Dr was summoned and who gave an anti titanus injection...later i found other rooms carpertners banging away at the beds as they may have had the same problem also the hotel is too close to a railway station with trains hooting away day and night.. Apr 5 2009 Nice Comfortable Hotel Room for Improvement We stayed three nights in total with a wedding party. The hotel\\'s decor is very impressive and modern. The rooms are comfortable and we had nice views of the city. The breakfast is decent but I\\'ve had better at similar level of hotels.The pool area is also newly renovated and is very nice. But I almost wished that it\\'s indoor because the air in Delhi is just so polluted that it wasn\\'t very enjoyable breathing in all the fumes and pollution while relaxing at the pool.The major complaint that I have is on the service. Check-in is extremely slow. If there were two or three people in front of you on line, be prepared to wait for over 20 minutes just to check in. We had to check in twice because our three nights were split up and both times we had similar experience.Also staff at front desk seem confused sometimes. One time a front desk person actually told me the wrong information regarding hours of the sauna room in the gym area. Another time I wanted to break a large bill and the person sent me down the desk to another area but ended with no one helping me. Despite the hiccups in service, it was a comfortable hotel and I would stay here again if I could get a good deal on a room. Mar 29 2009 Good could do with some improvements I stayed at this Hotel for one night on a Business Trip to Delhi. Hotel is quite centrally located, thats a major plus point.Crowded Lobby, Check in was chaotic, took some time to get my room allocated. Staff seemed confused and unable to handle large crowds at the same time.Room was nice and spacious, excellent view of the city, large comfortable bed, clean and large bathroom. Room Amneties were excellent. They even had cellphone chargers for most models in the room. Tried out room service for dinner. Order arrived on time, Food was good, not excellent.Breakfast spread the next morning was basic, not something to write home about. The Lunch buffet was however excellent, though expensive.There are two things that I did not like about the Hotel.1. The staff tend to linger around waiting for tips, it happened to me thrice during my stay. This irritated me quite a lot.2. Though Recession has brought down Hotel Tariffs, the rates for the all the other services and facilities remain the same. It seems stupid to pay over inflated prices for almost everything when the same thing is available outside for 1/10th the price. So even though I was travelling on company expense, it pinched.overall an average experience. recommended for Business travel only. Mar 26 2009 Luxury Hotel Superb Location! Loved It!!!!!! I\\'ve just stayed at the Lalit with my family for 2 nights in March.. This hotel is definately worth it\\'s points. The minute u walk in to the lobby, the features and decor are very modern. The service was great, I couldn\\'t say a bad thing about it, the pool area was lovely, my kids loved it. I\\'ve stayed in some 5 star hotels before, but this was even better than the ones we\\'ve stayed in London. You wouldn\\'t be disappointed, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. There was alot of business people around, but on our second day there was a few more families. There is a pastry shop in the hotel which is not to badly priced, but other than that we ordered drinks at the poolside bar, which was very steep. We had breakfast in the 24/7 restaurant, which was lovely, it was probably the best meal my kids had had since we had been in India. There was such a wide range, to cater for all. The hotel also had agradin area, where daytime shows were on, also on the second floor the hotel has a range of boutiques and gift shops. The best thing about the Lalit was the location. It is literally 5 minute walk from Connaught Place, 5 minute car jouirney to the train station and it only took us half an hour in peak time to the Airport. Overall, I would say I made a very good choice staying at the Lalit. I\\'d been looking for accomadtion for nearly 2 months prior to my journey. Having 3 young children, I wanted a nice hotel, with a good pool and in a good location. I had firstly booked the Radisson, but cancelled last minute due to it\\'s location. Lalit was definately very impressive! Mar 8 2009 The Lalit: A magnificent surprise in a great Delhi location I spent 4 days at this hotel in mid-Feb with my wife and son. The hotel was arranged by our Delhi office so I was a little surprised it was not a brand that I recognized....but boy, what an absolutely outstanding experience! While every aspect of my experience was great, with no negatives, here are the highlights:1. The people were the best thing about this hotel.....they were warm, friendly, polished and VERY hospitable. They made us feel really welcome and service was excellent at every place. (I thought they had mistaken me for some VIP, but my wife and son had the same experience). 2. The rooms were very nice..... bright, tastefully furnished, fairly large, and very well equipped. 3. The 24/7 restaurant is probably the best &quot;coffee shop&quot; I have experienced.....great food, served beautifully, in a very pleasant setting. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. While we had intended to eat out and try Delhi\\'s many restaurants, we ended up eating here pretty much all the time, . 4. The facility overall was beautiful.....it was rich without seeming formal; very bright, airy, beautifully decorated, with a collection of art by top Indian artists. (It\\'s the only hotel I know of that has a full-time curator! ).5. The location was superb....right in Connaught Place, in central Delhi. It is hard to find a better location in Delhi. It is close to shopping, business, government, parliament, the historic old Delhi, the newer monuments, etc.. Given Delhi\\'s traffic congestion, that was a major boon. I understand that the hotel has been recently renovated, which I am sure added to its attractiveness, but I have to believe that the outstanding service and flawless operation we experienced was the result of excellent management. (And you could see them all over the place all the time!). Bottom line, a superb hotel we would gladly recommend to our friends. Mar 8 2009 Loved this hotel I loved this hotel! I\\'ve travelled a lot and this would have to be one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. The room was fabulous, the staff were very attentive and helpful. The buffet was amazing - breakfast lunch and dinner and room service was spot on. The room was quiet, it had an ironing board - the only hotel I came across in India that had one!!! Attention to detail was excellent in the room - variety of newspapers, chocolates - all I can say was it was fantastic. Only downside was the pool was still closed for renovation, and the restaurant was a little expensive, but overall - I\\'d highly recommend it. Feb 18 2009 Recently renovated but pool is closed. Nicely renovated hotel. Good size rooms. Excellent interior decor. Somewhat noisy, even though our room was on a high floor. The hotel is right at the heart of the city. Dining is open 24/7, and breakfast is a tremendous feast. Pool is currently being renovated so is closed; gym is small but functional. Feb 4 2009 a treat When we first arrived in New Delhi we stayed at the Shangri-La but found it to be rather cold &amp; standoffish. When we returned to new Delhi we went to check in at Shangri-La again but found they\\'s increased the nightly rate over 25% or 120 USD in less than 2 weeks. We looked around and found La Lit to be the most reasonable luxury hotel that were willing to negotiate a fair price. The newly renovated rooms were stunning &amp; almost identical to rooms at the Shangri-La. We found the hotel atmosphere a lot friendlier and more welcoming and always bustling with locals and travellers. The breakfat buffet was outstanding! If given the choice would definately stay at La Lit! Would highly recommend this hotel- a real treat. Feb 3 2009 Excellently-designed city hotel dismal service We stayed at the Lalit recently on a visit to Delhi. The hotel has a lot of strong points...the design is top-notch: rooms are spacious, comfortable and fitted with high-quality and modern finishings/furnishings - you get what you pay for. The hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place shopping and dining, metro stations and even some other sites of interest. The 24/7 restaurant downstairs is fantastic, offering one of the best selections of food I have seen at a hotel in India. The major let-down were the poor response to some of the simply requests we had made, such as a packed breakfast, water, information, etc...I was expecting better. Extra services are mostly overpriced and poor in quality, as well. Overall, the accomodation represents the price you pay in an expensive city like Delhi, but they really need to work on their confused, disinterested staff. I did not encounter any signs of renovation work during my stay. Maybe it is over? Jan 2 2009 Impressed! This hotel is now called &quot;The Lalit - New Delhi&quot;.I stayed at this hotel for four nights. The hotel was under renovation at the time of my stay (including rooms and public spaces). I stayed in a recently renovated room. The room was very nice. Service throughout my stay was excellent. I ordered room service once (excellent and reasonably priced) and had multiple meals in the lobby dining area (24/7). The breakfast buffet is a decent value although the lunch buffet is very pricey (~$40/pp).I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Dec 22 2008 Avoidable hotel My experience was similar to that of Isabella. I stayed last week for 3 nights.Lobby and rooms are fine like most economical 5 stars but the hotel is undergoing major repair and therefore very noisy. Though the management always says that the work is mostly over or they stop work in the night if guests object etc but the fact is throughout the day and night carpenters, electricians and masons keep working and stop for 15 minutes if you object repeatedly and then resume work again which at times is very noisy. Very difficult to find restful sleep in this hotel. Besides, the hotel is very close to the train tracks and train make a big siren to keep people away from passing the tracks.Staff is a mixed lot, some are very polite and some very rude.Avoidable hotel. Dec 18 2008 Worth the price...if the price is mid-market My experience was most similar to IsabellaNewYork in her review below. There are some real nice touches in this hotel: recently-renovated rooms are modern and attractive with a big flatscreen TV and funky bathrooms. Also, the morning breakfast was very good, and I didn\\'t have the service problems that others had. In fact, it seems like the staff may have recently had a training course, since they were frequently extremely solicitous. I would add that there is also a nice gym on the mezzanene floor that is open 24/7.On the other hand, this is still a work in progress. I can report that, as of late December, the loud bangings associated with continued renovations are ongoing, though I never experienced it late at night. Also, my room (like IsabellaNewYork\\'s) was on the side with the train station, and while I got used to the constant whistles, it would be a much better experience on the other side of the building. Having traveld to India in the immediate aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, I was able to negotiate a much cheaper rate than TripAdvisor is listing (my rate was about $180), which I think is a very good deal given the high price of business hotels in Delhi and the many near-5-star ammenities this hotel offers.As others have noted, this hotel has shed its association with the InterContinental chian and is now called the Lalit New Delhi. All cabbies seem to know it as the InterContinental still, however. Dec 2 2008 Really good Hotel This is really excellent hotel, with exception: they did some works by night and there was more dust on the floor in front of hotel (in the morning). I came in Hotel very often early in the morning (01.00 - 03.00 o\\'clock) and must walking under the wall-workers -construction), on the other entrance and so on.Service was OK, food, people are very kind. Nov 22 2008 Overpriced The hotel has some great plusses and a few major negatives. Reception staff do not seem able to cope and are quite rude and off hand. Checking in is slow and my luggage took nearly forty minutes to arrive after completing the formalities. The lift service is totally inadequate. I regularly waited over five minutes for a lift to arrive (either on the lobby level or on the 18th floor where my room was located) and then it stopped at nearly every floor. The 24/7 restauant (main cafe style buffet eatery) serves excellent food but is very expensive compared to other indian hotels - rip off levels. The bedroom was superb with every comfort imaginable and excellent bathroom. Good location but the overall package could be so much better. Nov 6 2008 Nice stay The hotel has been recently renovated. The new look is very contemporary. Our stay was great, the rooms have a very modern look. The front facing rooms have a beautiful views. The bathrooms are very spacious. The restaurants especially 24/7 and Baluchi are very good. Oct 21 2008 awefull This is a rip off joint. I have stayed in hotels ranging 3 star to 7 stars but this is the only one which wouldn\\'t give any star ever. They charge like they are the best hotel in new delhi but other than that they have nothing. I\\'d have been better off in a B&amp;B for 2000Rs. Thats how much I think they should charge.No customer service, aweful food, construction and wierd check in process on 3-4th floor. The lady was good looking though.Thanks Oct 16 2008 Problematic hotel with potential Service in this hotel is hit and miss. Sometimes excellent and friendly, sometimes incompetent and rude. Overall, the hotel definitely has a long way to go to provide a consistent 5 star experience. Room was nice and very modern, with flat screen TV and a futuristic bathroom. Room had absurdly loud noise coming from a nearby commuter railway station. Trains were making piercing signals at all hours to warn people off the tracks. Have never experienced such noise levels in a hotel room, despite years of travelling around Asia. If you stay in this hotel, make sure to get a room away from the railway station!Hotel is 5 minutes walking distance from Connaught Place, a big shopping area that is dirty and has been decaying for decades. The area is nevertheless popular with tourists, and has a couple of decent restaurants.A couple of nights I was woken up around 1 am from loud banging that went on for a couple of hours: extensive renovation work is going on in the hotel at all hours.Breakfasts were excellent. Nice, bright restaurant and wide food selection. Staff sometimes seem tired and unmotivated. Getting a coffee refill is often a challenge.Dinner in the same restaurant was a depressing affair. When I pointed out that a particular vegetable was missing from the pizza despite being mentioned on the menu, the waiter silently took the plate away. He returned about seven minutes later, having added the missing vegetables on the original dish. The pizza by now was cold and even less appetizing. Another time, a salad in the main restaurant was mediocre.Room service was disappointing, to say the least. &quot;Grilled vegetables\\'&quot; turned out to be an unappetizing soup-like dish that was inedible. A sandwich was soggy an also unappetizing. Coffee was so weak it looked like weak tea. It is very hard to believe that any professionally trained chef could have had any hand in this food fiasco!Internet in the room is horrendously expensive, at 1.248 rupees including tax (more than 26 USD!). The login-process is clunky and sometimes problematic.Elevators are often malfunctioning, and there are often long waiting times.Indian newspapers have reported that starting next year, this hotel will no longer be part of the Intercontinental chain. Sep 14 2008 Exellent hotel This is a very good quality hotel, excellent facilities, huge, beautiful rooms, very clean, spectacular breakfasts, good restaurants, good service, very safe, knowledgeable staff. Would definitely go there again. Aug 23 2008 under renovation for at least one month or two ! We booked in this hotel for 2 nights in august to have some restfrom busy india, during august in delhi choose a hotel with swimming pool if possible its so hot !Well the reservation office forgot to tell us that the whole building and swimming was under renovation, that means dust and noise we chose a standard room, they gave us a suite but when the door lift opened, clouds of dust and noise invaded the corridor, it was like a joke movie.... we ran away from the hotelI wouldnt recommend this hotel for its lack of information or sincerity... May 20 2008 Totally Horrible Service Stayed there from 16-19 May. It was horrible experience. The staff was unfriendly. I arrived in the hotel at midnight. When I lined up for check-in at 3rd floor, the staff gave a head signal to the bellboy and asked him to take me to international club at 20th flr for check-in. That was really rude. She didn\\'t even bother to say anything to me. The hotel is going through renovations. I could hear the noise/bang sound when I woke up in the morning. I still could hear the bang when I came back to the hotel before dinner time. The TV and telephone in my room didn\\'t work at all. I used my international mobile to call receptionist and informed her that telephone in my room didn\\'t work. All TV channels, except one, had no signals. It took forever for them to fix this.Unless the hotel upgrades their quality of service and improves its staff etiquette and professionalism, this hotel does not deserve to be called \\'class hotel\\'.I really hate this hotel and will never recommend it to my friends and networks! May 15 2008 Best value \"good\" hotel in Delhi great gym. The intercontinental is my hotel of choice for Delhi. In an expensive city, it offers good value. As already noted, the renovations are not too disturbing.The rooms are fantastic and the hotel\\'s best feature. Most if not all have plasma tvs and great bathrooms. The gym/spa is fantastic and a great way to finish the day. The restaurant is also excellent, open 24 hours (and experienced this by ordering a steak at 3am - perfect) and the bars offer a wide choice. The location is brilliant and if you dont want to pay c.£200, this is a great option. May 13 2008 Beware of the renovations! Stayed at this hotel for a couple of days R&amp;R and sightseeing at the end of a business trip in the region and have to say I was disappointed.The location of the hotel is great, on the edge of the Government district of new Delhi but within very easy walking distance of Connaught Place - but the quality did not live up to my expectations of an Inter-continental.The main thing to frustrate me was that the hotel is currently in the midst of major renovations. The lobby is reduced to being a corridor - some of the lifts are out of action and significantly, the pool and surrounding area is completely a building site. The pool is to be closed for 3-4 months apparently. Hammering and drills started at 8 in the morning and carried on until late at night. Worst of all however - even though I only booked 2-3 weeks before travle, I was told none of this and there was no mention on the hotel website.I did stay in one of the renovated rooms and it was very nice (if slightly small) but there were clearly teething problems. My broadband wouldn\\'t work so I had to call a guy to come and set me up with a separate connection each time I needed to go on line. And the cost of the broadband was extortionate! The 24hour restaurant was unaffected by the renovation but the food was ok at best - breakfast was a big disappointment. Room service was polite and prompt with a good selection, but again food quality was average at best.In summary, great central location, with the potential to be great - but get the renovations out the way first, and then expect to pay over the odds for average food and service Apr 10 2008 The Level of Service is Impressive I am on a PC points stay at this property. As an Royal Ambassador, this is the best value in the system. The level of service and attention to detail is extrordinary. My sense is tht they deeply care about the people staying at the hotel. Because I am here for medical reasons, the location of this hotel is ideal -- 2 blocks from Bengali Market. 3 Blocks from connaught place.The rennovated rooms are very nice if you don\\'t want a suite. I would opt for an executive suite or luxury suite in the Presidential tower. I stayed 2 nights in 1115. Very quiet. looks over the pool (now close d for rennovation). But the two luxury suites on the 21st floor are good for sleeping. Room 2121 has a great view of the cricket fields at the Modern school, and the view wraps around. It\\'s pretty spectacular.If you are an PC Ambassador, the club lounge has breakfast 8-10:30, tea 3-5, and cocktails 6:30-8:30. It is on the 20th floor right below 2121. The 21st floor presidential rooms have no one on top of you. They are very quiet--but not yet rennovated.The elevators are under wraps right now so sometimes you might have to wait. But the new spa, steam room, suana and gym portend a bright future for this property once it is completely rennovated. Mar 2 2008 Comfortable stay. Stayed at &quot;The Grand&quot; from 25th to 28th Feb. We had travelled up from Goa and looked forward to our first trip to Delhi. I had pre paid for the room and check in was efficient and professional. I requested a renovated room and was given a beautifully apointed room on the 11th floor. Rm 1127. The room was very confortable and you can request harder pillow if the soft pillows are not to your liking. I was already aware of the ongoing renovations but wasn\\'t aware that the pool is also closed. It didn\\'t affect our stay as the visit was short. We availed of the buffet meals every day and the quality was excellent if not a little expensive by Indian standards. The location is excellent and it is only a short walk to Connaught Place. We also walked to India Gate. Taxis are easy to to arrange with the consierge staff. The only &quot;not so positive&quot; incident happened at checkout. I was given my bill and the hotel had again charged me for the accomodation that I had already pre paid. I didn\\'t notice until I had left the desk. I returned to the desk and pointed out the error. The situation was recitified but it was done with a grimace from the desk. I was not offered an apology or an explanation. However, I have booked again to stay from 3rd to the 6th June 2008. I would recommend this hotel if you are visiting Delhi. The renovations are hardly noticable and the staff are generally professional and helpful.Ken Brydon and PJ Hogan Feb 22 2008 In spite of ongoing renovations - a class hotel Over the past several years I have stayed at the Grand on at least five occasions - and if it was as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be, I would not have stayed there as often as I did. In fact, for New Delhi it is very good. I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza (Friends Colony), Le Meridien, the Maurya Sheraton and the Imperial, and for comfort, value and service, it is the equal of all but the Imperial, which I rate as one of the world\\'s great hotels. The renovated club rooms are superb.No doubt it is expensive, nearly $500 a night for a renovated club during a high demand period (during an international trade fair), but similar hotels in New Delhi are even more expensive. When I visited, the hotel was still undergoing renovations - the lobby was restrictive and the pool closed. However, other than that there were no impositions on the guests. The Indian restaurant (Baluchi?) on the third floor was superb and good value for a 5 star hotel in New Delhi. The Chinese Restaurant on the roof top was disappointing. The 24/7 bar in the lobby has gone modern (glass and clean lines) and not to my taste - I preferred the old Champions Sports Bar which it replaced. Having said that, it is a good watering hole, excellent service, good selection of drinks and best of all, open 24 hours a day.For the business traveller this is a very good hotel - good rooms (renovated ones), good service and good location. I would also recommend this hotel for the tourist, especially if they can get a discounted rate. A very satisfactory hotel, indeed. Feb 18 2008 Good for business travellers and tourist This hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Delhi. Facilities are good, even if at the present time (02/2008), some refurbishing work is causing some limited access to the lobby. I have used the internal travel agency to arrange a one day tour of the town and I have been very pleased of the service offered. I paid 1000 rupees (20$) for a full day group tour; it turned out that the group was only a party of three and the guide was excellent, he spoke a good english, was very well prepared and ready to answer any question. I have also tried two internal restuarants, offereng respectively indian and chinese food. A little bit pricey (50$ for a good dinner, without wine) but still acceptable. Main negative point is the noise from the nearby railway line, quite loud.Overall I can recommend this hotel to both business travellers and tourists. Jan 26 2008 Not worth the high cost The hotel is undergoing some major construction. The lobby is not really a lobby with the construction going on. The taxi and rickshaw drivers have a tough time finding this place for some reason. We were put in a room that is not renovated yet. It was ok, but the renovated section looks so much better. The rooms are very spacious. The hotel seems to be more of a business type hotel. It just didn\\'t justify the price we paid for it.The concerige service is not very helpful and quite unfriendly. The room service and restaurants are very good. Everything I ordered was very tasty. I don\\'t think I would stay here again. Jan 10 2008 Fantastic After reading the mixed reviews on here I had fairly low expectations about this hotel. In fact it was a fantastic surprise. The renovation works continue but are now of minimum disruption and the newly refurbished areas are really great, with very modern and cool design. The reception area was not completely finished although even here you can see how good it\\'s going to look. We were given one of the refurbished rooms on the 21st floor and it was very cool with great piture window, modern interior design, giant LCD TV and DVD, cool bathroom with seperate rainshower.The heated (useful in January) outdoor swimming pool on one of the hotel\\'s roofs is a real bonus as it\\'s wonderful to escape to this tranquil space in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Delhi city centre. It was dissapointing that the spa was more or less out of service, with just some basic facilities available. The hotel\\'s website is kept up to date with what is and is not available during the works though.The Grill restaurant on the top floor has a great menu and they\\'re happy to make something off menu for you if you ask. The quality\\'s great. Breakfast\\'s also top notch. I stayed in the Taj Palace a few weeks earlier and much prefered the Intercontinental Grand. It\\'s much cooler, has more buzz and a better location all for a similar price. Dec 28 2007 Expensive ( 314€/night) - in Indian comparison This place is way too expensive by India comparison. And by international comparison as well. Even in Tokyo you can stay at cheaper price and with more comforts.LOCATIONNote that there is anotehr The Grand New Delhi in the city as well. This place has nothing to do with Intercontinental The Grand. Taxi driver may have problems finding this place even though it is supposedly centrally located. So have the address at hand. And even if you have the address taxies may not find the place. Intercontineltal The Grand states it is on the Marakhambra Avenue, off Connaught Place. In reality it is some 700 metres from Connaught Place and not on Marakhambra Avenue but on a small side street off it and next to the highway and very close to the railway. You can here the trains passing by in rooms facing east.ROOMSStay away of the old rooms at all cost. The new rooms are very very nice (see prictures). However at over 300€ per night these are way too expensive. Especially by international comparison. Furthermore, hotels on Jampath are more centrally located - and some of them cheaper.HOTEL PREMISESThe lobby area was undergoing a major refurbisment in December 2007. Check in facilities were crammed to one corner while the whole otherwise big lobby was closed off for renovations. Pool area is a serous need of renovation as well. Gladly the pool was heated. Restaurant on the ground floor is of international standard - but at similar of even higher prices.RECOMMEDATIONInstead of the big international names I would look for a 3 star Indian operated place close to Jampath. You\\'d get more value for you money - at a fraction of the cost. Nov 28 2007 Short stay in a flash one The room rate was extortionate (US$550/night plus taxes) but the room was incredible. How the team here made a small room into a masterpiece of open space architecture is incredible. The illusion of a large room is great. If you are a Hotel Architect, go here and check out the magic.Very impressed with the small things too like International Power Plugs as standard!The renovations down stairs were still on and that also affected the Gym setting. The pool meshed over is an interesting concept but it does not keep out the smog!.The breakfast setting was stunning and the ground floor restaurant is brilliant. There is tons of choice for food at breakfast here.Loved it...except for the room rate!ProsBest room setting for standard hotelBreakfast!Service was exceptional in all aspectsConsRoom price Nov 21 2007 Avoid at all costs! Stayed on 18th Nov fortunately for only one night. As foyer is being rebuilt we were sent to a waiting area on first floor to check in. This backed on to the works and we were seperated by only a short wallfrom the building going on. It was extremeley dusty and noisy. One worker was arc welding a few feet from where we were sitting! The man who came to check us in was oblivious to the problem. We were in the unmodernised rooms. These are disgraceful. The carpets were badly stained and sticky. The bath was badly rusted around the waste and looked dirty. The new rooms may be nice but the old ones would do shame to a one star hotel. We went into the restaurant to see if we could have a meal. We were told that only meal available was Sunday Brunch. Thiis was a buffet costing 3,000 rupees each (about £40 ). We had no alternative but to go for this as there are no nearby restaurants. 20 minutes after going in we were told that the buffet was closing in 2 minutes. Sure enough in 2 minutes they started to clear away the food. No one had bothered to tell us that the buffet was about to close when we went in. We were still charged the 3.000 rupees.Do not go near this hotel! Nov 14 2007 The Intercontinental The Grand Delhi We stayed at the Intercontinental during a short business trip intending to stay longer when the trip was ended but we changed our minds. The new rooms are big and have a glass walled see through bathroom but not a single mirror lit properly to apply make up in my case or shave in my husbands case -too trendy by half. A plasma screen TV not programmed in in either room we stayed in. The main problem alongside the constant renovation is that there is no decent outside space.The terrace by the dining room could be nice but has an extractor fan from the kitchen fed directly onto it and the poolside is grubby and meshed over and is not welcoming. For a business stay make it short and for a holiday go to a hotel with an outside space or a garden.Ask for a room overlooking the pool - otherwise the railway station keeps you awake all night. Nov 10 2007 Great Stay I was in new Delhi for business and stayed at the Intercontinental Grand. I think that this hotel is great! I was upgraded to a Club Room with free breakfast. I love the contemporary feel of the Intercontinental. Although it is undergoing renovations, my stay was very comfortable. Staff are great and I have really nothing to complain about. The chauffered mercedez car that we hired from the hotel for 3 days also made our journey through meetings in New Delhi very easy and the driver has great knowledge of the area. He brought us to interesting tourist areas in between our meetings. The Wok restaurant at the 28 level has amazing food. The breakfast served at &quot;24/7&quot; restaurant was adequate. Nov 7 2007 Rip of After reading other reviews, I got a renovated room, so far so good. The decoration is Ok for a 5 star hotel. Service I received was only 2 star class worth, for exemple the shower was not ounes cleaned during my stay, also they never vacuumed the room. The breakfast was very basic. The rate for such hotel + service is a real rip of. Oct 28 2007 On its way up. I stayed at the Intercontinental - The Grand last week for 2 mights while in Delhi on business. Its the second time I\\'ve stayed in this hotel, the first time was about 2-3 years ago, and its definately improving.A few words of warning. The hotel is currently under rennovation, and so the lobby is a real mess. Its all boarded up and there is no where to sit. They told me that 3/4 of the rooms have already been rennovated, and I was upgraded from a regular king room to a &quot;club&quot; room. From my room I wasn\\'t disturbed by the noise of the rennovations, but the smell of paint in the lobby is almost overwhelming. They also told me rennovations will be complete by March 2008, so keep all this in mind.I remember from the last time I was there the rooms were typical Indian old style, carpet on the floors and classic furniture. They were nice rooms but they were nothing fancy. Certainly well below what you would expect from an Intercontinental. But the rennovated rooms are absolutely superb. Parquet floors, a bed that was on par with Shangrila beds (which are my usual favorite), modern decorations, a 42&quot; plasma TV, and a fantastic bathroom with a separate bath and a huge rain shower. The bathroom has glass walls so you can watch CNN while you\\'re in the shower (or on the loo!). I have to say the room was trully 5 star. There was also a nice big desk and a comfortable office chair, the same one that is pretty much standard for Intercontinental. One gripe, the internet connection was good, but very expensive. After tax it was 1250 rupees (about 25 euros) for 24 hours, which is ridiculous.I ate the buffet in the 24/7 cafe. The cafe/restaurant itself has been fully renovated and is very nice. The food was excellent, but typically expensive - about 2000 rupees for lunch or dinner per person. Service was excellent.The gym was a bit of a dissapointment - very small and no eliptical cross trainer. Hopefully that will also eventually be changed. Location is good, very central in Delhi.Overall, the hotel is definately going in the right direction. Its well on its way to a genuine Intercontinental standard. One note: Hotels in New Delhi are INSANELY over-priced. I paid 16000 rupees per night (including the luxury tax) which was the lowest rate I could find in any decent hotel in New Delhi. When you compare the room I had with rooms at the Park, or the Metropolitan, or even the Le Meridien, where the rooms were even more expensive, I rate this hotel as excellent value, all things considered. Oct 23 2007 Good Hotel for India Stayed 2 nights and 1 night on seperate visits to hotel in both new and old rooms. I thought the standard of both types of rooms were fairly good; particularly nice beds. The older rooms aren\\'t as nice as the very modern new ones, but the older room I got was much larger. Renovation noise was noticable but I sleep pretty soundly; probably not a good idea to stay in this hotel if you\\'re a light sleeper till they finish. Service is good if you are persistent (like everything in India, things take time and patience). I got some decent food through room service. Breakfast is particularly good. Overall, I\\'d say it\\'s a good hotel but I\\'m not too sure I\\'d pay the full retail price for it (which I didn\\'t). Oct 20 2007 watch the phone calls Watched the phone calls...They rip you stupid in this hotel.I got charged a 12.5% luxury tax on REVERSE charge international calls that NOONE answered at the other end.Paid $4000 rupee for a total of 5 min of calls.Breakfast buffet was pretty good and rooms are very nice, but the views are horrible. Sep 29 2007 nice rooms This hotel is very old. There is some construction going on, so you might find it a little annoying. Restaurnants and bar are disappointing and pricy. I paid $198/night which I consider as a really good deal since hotels in Delhi tend to be very expensive. Service was excellent and my room was very well decorated and clean. They have DVD players in each room. I brought some DVDs and watched all of them! Internet access is expensive. I paid Rs.1,000/24hrs (about USD25.) Most nice hotels in the U.S. charge $9.99/day, so this is absolutely a lot. Location is ok. It\\'s quite far to Connaught place to walk. But you can always take the subway(only one stop to Connaught place,) or taxi. Aug 15 2007 Grand Ripoff Ideal location and earnest labor staff aside, the hotel is poorly managed, ridiculously expensive and oddly designed Poor management * Power outages are a norm* Electrical issues in rooms* Missed wakeup call* Uncoordinated reception staffRidiculously Expensive* laundry bill for 1 tshirt, 1 track suite, pair of socks and undershirt was Rs. 1900 = $50+. Criminal.* Internet per day is $30+ (Rs. 1000). Again outrageous.* Cheaper room are in construction areas -- avoid unless you like the smell of varnish and paint and the noise of a hammerOdd Design* trying to be post-modern without following basic design principles* oddest shower stall i have seen* no room to put away clothes* a/c that makes certain areas too cold and the rest of room not as coldEarnest Labor Staff* Not the well-dressed reception area staff who are mostly incompetent, but the poorly paid room service staff and the engineering labor staff.All in all, a hotel that pretends to be something that it isn\\'t and probably doesn\\'t know and doesn\\'t care. For the money you have to pay, there are surely better deals in New Delhi. Jul 30 2007 Good business hotel in city center This InterContinental property is managed and run by an Indian hotel group which owns &quot;The Grand&quot; brand in India. The hotel is very centrally located if you are on business at Delhi. The recently renovated rooms are great - especially those in the executive floor. A glass-walled bathroom, big-size plasma tv, good bedding, comfortable work desk and top-of-the-line amenities makes the room experience satisfying. The executive lounge is great with nice range of drinks and some finger foods. A good place to socialize and do quick business meetings. The breakfast is good - both on spread as well as on quality. The hotel is undergoing a renovation which can cause some minor disturbance (especially the noise) during your stay. I would recommend this hotel only for those who needs a hotel close to city center. If you are okay with any place in Delhi, you may find a better hotel at a much better price. Jul 2 2007 Charmless but the hotel is going through renovation The hotel is currently being renovated: ask for one of they renovated bedroom which are very nice, preferably facing the pool (and not facing the train station as it can be very very noisy.)Rooms and restaurant are quite expensive and in my opinion is not worth it. It might be when the hotel will be fully renovated: currently there is no terasse to enjoy a drink in the evening or have your diner. The bar is pretty horrible (undergoound, loud western music, big screen tv, smoky). All in all it is charmless although my bedroom was nice. I was meant to stay 2 weeks, @ $180 a night. I stayed one week and moved to the Imperial for the same price (booked on the net) which is just FANTASTIC. If you want to spend this sort of money in a hotel, do not chose the Grand, or at least not before it is fully renovated. May 3 2007 Musty rooms and not very clean This was not the most expensive place in Delhi and it showed. Our room was very musty and not very clean. Construction was in progress in some of the hotel. We found a much better place for much less money on the south side of Delhi at the end of our trip. Apr 20 2007 Floors that should have been closed in this hotel We recently stayed in this hotel between 14th and 17th April. We were given rooms on 18th and 21st floors (2 occasions). Renovation was ongoing with considerable noise through the day starting at 8.00am to around 6.00pm.Because of the summer heat in Delhi we had to return to the hotel in the afternoons and there was no peace bacause of the noise. This was pointed out to the Customer Relations saffed by a very young inexperienced girl who had to refer to the Manager on duty. The Manager\\'s response was that of &quot;take it or leave it&quot; that is your choice. I can understand his attitude as the rooms were booked through a local travel agent who had been pre-paid.The most polite personnel in the hotel were the lift and baggage attendants. Apr 14 2007 Nice 4 star hotel in a not so nice area. I was going to India for a week and was terrified to read the reviews of the hotels in Delhi. They all said the hotels were expensive and below par. Well this hotel was very expensive but I have to say it was a solid 4 star hotel. Everything about it was great including the pool, bar, and restaurant. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel staff is that the doorman, who is a large turbine headed man, would give me dirty looks when I gave him a 20 rupee tip for getting me a cab. I though this as uncalled for since the I was told the daily wage in Delhi for a laborer is 80 rupees a day. The hotel restaurant was very expensive with dinner buffet costing about $40 US. But the food was outstanding with a wide variety of continental and Indian foods. So I ate there more than once and enjoyed it.The hall on my floor did smell of insecticide but on the positive note there were no insects. The hotel states that it is on Conneaut Circle which is the center of Delhi. Well it is not on the Circle but about a mile from it. And with the beggars, hawkers and traffic it is only walk able during the day if you have some courage. But it is not walkable at night. And the problem of getting one of the taxis is that I found them quite unreliable with them taking me constantly to their shops or just out of the way. And another point is that once you are in Conneaut Circle there is not much there aside from more beggars and hawkers. I found one decent coffee shop and no restaurants. So if you stay at the hotel don’t think that you will be walking out and be in the center of a cosmopolitan Mecca. Apr 12 2007 Do not recommend as far from \"Value For Money\" I frequently come to Delhi for business purpose and I wanted to experience this hotel.With my wife we stayed 4 nights in the first half of April \\'07. Room attributed to us ,thank to my Priority Club Member card was quite comfortable and well located. In fact we were lucky not to be disturbed by the noise resulting from the rehabilitation work currently in progress. We heard around us many complaints about this. Unfortunately we cannot say the same about the rest of the services.Quality of food available in Self Service Restaurant is relatively poor and choice limited. Certainly overpriced compared to the hotels within the same range.Expresso coffee at 5 USD , of very mediocre quality is more expensive than the express in some Palaces in Europe.Internet available in the Standard Room at 10 USD/ hour is absolutely scandalous. In some Guest House in Delhi/Gurgaon ( B&amp; B at USD 50- 70 ), WIFI internet is available and free!Staff at reception is nice but relatively slow.This Hotel is not reflecting the reputation of ICH group and needs serious improvements.We do not recommend this hotel for the moment. Mar 21 2007 Noisy and beware the renovations Checked in the afternoon after travelling for 27 hrs and got allocatted a smoking room which reeked of smoke. The room was shabby and needed a complete make-over. After complaining and requesting non-smoking room were offered a room &quot;newly renovated&quot; . Minimalist with a nice plasma screen. Nobody mentioned the fact that the floor\\'s service area was still being renovated which was opposite our room.Needing some shut-eye the constant banging and knocking kept us awake. After calling reception and the duty manager around 7pm &quot;I will tell them to stop immediately&quot;. The banging continued for another 1.5hrs. Also the room was at the back of the hotel facing the railway station; so between the tooting of the trains throughout the night and the banging during the day we got very little sleep over the 3 nights we spent there. This impacted on the business meetings we had as we kept on dozing off!Being &quot;newly renovated&quot;, the bar fridge didn\\'t work (fixed after five attempts by handymen) the hand basin didn\\'t drain and there was a big gap in the ceiling above the shower rose. It seems that these details were not a problem with the front staff as nobody bothered to fix it-even after complaining. There were some big conferences on at the time so the hotel was quite full; explained the attitude of some of the front desk staff.The food at the breakfast buffet was OK but it was better to choose from the a la carte menu for dinner. Beware of the add on charges. We were quoted U$ 30 for 24 hrs of access to internet using wi-fi to which was added a service charge, government tax, as well as a luxury charge so ended up paying 35% more. Cheaper at the internet cafe near the hotel.If you do stay at the hotel ask for a renovated roon away from the railway station and certainly not where they are renovating. Mar 13 2007 Okay hotel but nothing special (maybe overpriced) I was here for just one day, but I must say that the hotel needs some upgrading. The rooms were perfect, but the lobby/reception could use some upgrading. The staff at the reception is very slow and inefficient. The restaurant is nice. Swimming pool closes too early. Location is fine. Make sure you\\'re minibar is filled with all the things that should be in there!!! Breakfast in business lounge is rather limited I think. For the rest it is ok, but probably a bit overprices (as all hotels in Delhi). Mar 9 2007 OK Hotel I was somewhat cautious when I stayed here after reading the reviews, but we had no problems at all. I was travelling with 2 other work colleagues and this hotel met our needs just fine. The room was very quiet (aside from the occasional train tooting), but I had specifically asked for a quiet room, and I liked the large plasma TV in my room. Actually a colleague on the higher floor (more expensive), only had a normal Tv! Location is near Connaught place which is relativly central. The Bathroom was a little dark, and the bath tub had a stain in it. But overall for the price etc, I was satisfied with his hotel, plus I only slept and ate breakfast here (of which I liked the freshly cookedwaffles a lot). But avoid breakfast rushhour on Sunday around 10am, too many people! Feb 24 2007 Fine for me- but I was lucky Having read the reviews I dreaded my stay.The room was clean enough- quiet enough-no problems...BUT- it seems I was lucky as other members of the party had had a noisy and miserable night. Feb 10 2007 Avoid bad experience I was on a 2 week business trip to India and was looking forward to my stay here as all the other hotels I have stayed in here have been excellent. However, this place has some major problems. All sorts of issues that add up to an irritating and unsatisfactory experience. First, I booked a non smoking room. When I went to check in there were no non smoking rooms available and they told me that I could have a smoking room and change tomorrow. When I book something normally it\\'s booked - right? I didn\\'t expect to book something and find it was not really booked. I got the impression there was a big conference that had block booked some rooms, and my one person stay was not too important to them. The room they put me in is above an intersection of 3 streets and as anyone knows who has been to India, on the streets they honk their car horns constantly. This would not have been a problem if the windows closed properly in the room, but they seem to be screwed in place, with some of the screws coming loose, with the effect that some of the windows don\\'t open or close properly and the effect is that the car horn noise comes into the room constantly. The room is OK but pretty shabby. The front control panel is missing from the television. The bathroom does not look particularly clean. Wireless internet is advertised but the wireless does not connect. I was under the impression that having put me in a smoking room I didn\\'t want when I arrived, that someone was going to call me the day after I arrived, to let me know when I was switching rooms - nothing happened. It is the service here that is really lacking. I was knocked out by the service standards of the first hotel I stayed in (the ITC Sheraton &amp; Towers in Chennai), but the service here is poor by the normally high Indian standards. They have this system where you dial &quot;9&quot; for any requests, this links you their &quot;Instant Help Center&quot;. This is a good idea in principle, but the people who answer the phone have such a very poor grasp of English that it can be an irritating experience. I called &quot;9&quot; to ask they why I had not been contacted about changing rooms. They answered the phone with the words &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained the situation, long pause on the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained again, long pause at the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;. You get the picture, you might as well talk to the cat. Instant, but not exactly help. I finally said, &quot;you can\\'t understand anything I\\'m saying - can you?&quot;, they then said &quot;one moment sir&quot;, pause for 2 minutes of &quot;hold music&quot;. The receptionist was then out on the phone and gave me the impression that they had no intentions of contacting me about my room change, it was kind of up to me to remind them. Not impressive. I also asked them why it was 2pm and my room had not been cleaned. They said there must have been a &quot;DND&quot; notice on the room when the cleaner was there. Why do people in a customer care role use meaningless jargon when dealing with the public? I finally figured out that DND meant &quot;do not disturb&quot;. True - there was a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; notice on my room at 8am, but I\\'d kinda hoped that between 8am and 2pm a cleaner might have returned. The concierge service was a similarly disappointing experience. I went down there this morning and got some information about a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. The guy gave me some information and I said I\\'d think about it and come back later. About 4 hours later I went back to the concierge desk and it was unmanned. I waited, and waited and waited. Around 10 minutes went by, with receptionist staff at my side (sometimes not even serving customers) simply ignoring me. I finally got hold of one of the receptionists to try to see where the concierge was and they got hold of somebody. I thought this guy was also a concierge, but it turned out it was just someone they got hold of, he didn\\'t have much of a clue how to help me, but said the concierge would call me by four. Four came and went and I called the ever useful &quot;9&quot; number and asked to be put through to the concierge, long pause again, the receptionist answered and stated that the concierge still was not around, but he would call me in 10 minutes. Thirty minutes later I gave upon getting a phone call and went down to the concierge desk and found him myself. The electricity here also seems to drop out for around 5 seconds, I was sitting in the bath last night and the lights went out. Each time the lights have gone out they have come back on again, but I fear they may not one time. Also a note for all us Americans and Western Europeans who are used to smoking being banned in enclosed public spaces. Word of warning - it is not here, and worse, there is little or no sign-posting to indicate where you can smoke and where you cant. I was having a coffee and a pastry in the coffee area just off reception (where the service was very unresponsive and slow) when I was engulfed in tobacco fumes. This is a pretty horrible experience when you are not used to it. I would not recommend this place, they seem complacent and don\\'t seem to care about their customers. The ITC Sheraton\\'s I have stayed in here have much cleaner rooms and their service standard are excellent. Feb 6 2007 Grander than we thought We stayed at the Intercontinental Grand New Delhi during January 07.On arrival we got a 5* greeting at the door. This was our first time in Delhi so we had no idea what to expect and having read previous reviews on this hotel was a little daunted that it was part of our package. We loved it. Yes there is building work going on so there is some noise at times. The rooms are being updated to reflect the trend in contemporary décor. The views aren’t great but even if they were the smog is so thick you probably couldn’t enjoy them anyway!We were on floor 18 with views of the railway station and the highway with its constant horn blowing. It was fun watching the local life and the horns are part of the experience, just like in New York but louder, longer and more frequent!In our deluxe room we had a super king bed. The sheets and duvet were wonderful, cool smooth cotton of very high quality. It was really comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired so I think this room was awaiting redecoration but it was still clean with mountains of fresh fluffy clean towels. Strangely there was only one robe and one pair of slippers. There was all you could want - shampoo, body lotion, conditioner, soap, shoe shiner, comb, toothbrush kit, shave kit and vanity kit. There was a safe, hairdryer, iron and board, a well stocked reasonably priced mini bar and tea &amp; coffee making facilities. A great little perk was the complimentary provision of 2 litres of mineral water daily. The Delhi news was also delivered daily (printed in English).The food in the hotel was excellent we never had a bad meal any upset tummies.Champions bar was brilliant. A never ending range of international drinks were available and good food. Here superb entertainment was provided by a four piece live band covering some of the best oldies. The drummer does The Eagles &amp; Chris Rear brilliantly and a female singer who could sing Karen Carpenter and Sade. If you weren’t watching you’d have swore they were the real thing - Awesome!Baluchis is the Indian Restaurant. We ate here for one lunch and one dinner during our 3 nights and found it faultless. The service and food was excellent. Tell them what you normally eat back home and they’ll advise on what you might like to order.Rendevous is the international buffet. The choice here was enormous. Ranging from continental, Indian, Chinese &amp; Japanese. The desserts were to die for. Tiny slices and portions so you could have more than one at a time - great to try all the different flavours. Rendevous is also where the buffet breakfast was served; again loads of choice for all nationalities.We didn’t eat at Art Juntion but it is at pool level on the 2nd floor serving snacks such as Nachos, club sandwich etc. There’s a great pool if you get time to use it.Also on Floor 2 is a jeweller. He was very happy to do a deal, very friendly and spoke brilliant English.Taxis and guides are always keen to take you to government shops. These are small malls where Indian handicrafts such as carpets, fabrics, scarves jewellery etc are sold. If you buy carpet, furniture etc the government will pay to send it back home for you. I then later read in ‘rough guide’ that there are fake government shops and whoever takes you there gets commission on your sale so beware if this will bother you.All in all a satisfactory stay was had. The service was good, the rooms were more than comfortable with lots of amenities and the food excellent - what more could you want? Feb 6 2007 Good hotel My 2-nite hotel stay was good. The staff was very helpful. Food was average. Room was average, but still clean and quiet. It was quite pricey, so I can\\'t say the service or facilities were of equal value. Internet access was over $20US for 24 hours. Jan 29 2007 Better than expected.... We were concerned about this hotel as a result of TripAdviser reviews but were given reassurances by our booking agent. It was pleasing to find that the hotel in our view provided acceptable, but not wonderful, accommodation in an excellent location for a few days in Delhi. Renovated, minimalist (and upgraded) room was fine with only occasional, minor day time intrusions from the hotel renovation programme. We found the entire reception staff to be most helpful with only one misunderstanding about billing. Room service, especially dealing with minor problems could have been faster and more reliable. Be wary of the inhouse travel service whose drivers like to take you on unexpected shopping expeditions! Excellent breakfast and a Chinese (!) restaurant to remember. Overall, an enjoyable experience in an only slightly faded venue. Jan 21 2007 delayed checkout i was in this hotel last week ,and can truly say this was a terrible experience,however if you have time on your hands,and dont mind waiting 45 minutes to check out,my collegue waited 1.30 to checkout.this is the place to stay.there are much better hotels than this. Jan 18 2007 Disappointing service from a global brand The Hotel Intercontinental The Grand in New Delhi in no way lived up to the expectations that we had of either the Intercontinental chain nor any hotel where the rooms cost more than US $300 per night.I was part of a large group staying at the above hotel and also spending considerable amounts on the use of the hotel\\'s conference facilities. We were extremely disappointed with the quality of the accommodation and the level of service received when we raised our concerns.Several members of our group had to request to change rooms because the rooms we were allocated were unsatisfactory: they were dirty, smelled bad or were in generally poor or shabby condition. My own room smelled dreadful and the window did not fit in the frame, meaning a draught came through the gap and I could hear all the traffic noise. We had been offered newly renovated roomsa t the time fo booking, but we had to fight to get them.In general the response from staff was indifferent and not attentive to our concerns the first time they were expressed. I had to call three times to ask to change rooms and was passed to several members of staff and was cut off twice. Even then, I had to wait more than an hour for a resolution, which only came when I went to reception myself to complain. A colleague was offered the opportunity to finally change rooms - at midnight!I appreciate that we are priviledged to be able to stay in such an expensive hotel in a country where there is such abject poverty, but I do not feel that the service justified the price nor that the service relfected that which I would expect of the Intercontinental brand. Jan 11 2007 Loud hotel with unprofessional personnel! Intercontinental Grand in New Delhi is a huge 25 stories hotel with no soul. They renovated a few rooms on the different floors, they look good, but all the other- old and smelly. Carpets smell so bad, you can\\'t even imagine! And hotel located just next to railway station with trains departing every minute! And next to the main road. As you might know, Indian drivers horn all the time, traffic never stops in Delhi, so it is just inpossible to sleep without strong earplugs. We were in 3 different rooms until we found something quiet. Restaurant is ok, it is safe to eat there. Hotel has an army of personnel, they have a quard on every floor, tonns of concierges and receptionists, and they all want money!!! They grab your bags and then tell you that you should pay them. Unbelievable! Jan 4 2007 Loved It!! After reading all the reviews, I left London with a heavy heart. The last time I was in Delhi was 6 years ago and we stayed at this hotel and had a great time. But I have to say that the service we received was impeccable. We did stay in the Club rooms, which were pricey but we wanted comfort. The rooms were great. The breakfasts in the morning were superb, the pickups were a great service, and we were very happy. The location is wonderful, and we were able to get around very easily. I would definitely come here again, once we have saved up some money of course!! Dec 29 2006 Not recommended at all The room was nicely decorated but the bathroom was extremely dusty and there was leftover grime in the sink that looked like it hadn\\'t been wiped in ages. The shower drain and sink drain both clogged up, creating a mini flood in the bathroom. The worst part of our stay however was the awful front desk service They could barely speak English and as a result could not answer many of our basic questions. For example, they were supposed to call us with more information about our tour bus pick up time and place, but never called. When I called down to ask for this information, they kept insisting, &quot;No problem ma\\'am, we have the contact list so we will take care of it. &quot; I tried asking the same question 10 different ways but gave up after a while. As a result of their incompetence, several people were missing on our bus and our departure was delayed by quite a bit. We also placed a 1-800 call to the US that the hotel operator assured us would be free of charge, but the hotel charged us $70 for the call anyway. We tried speaking to management about this but they refused to drop the charge. Dec 27 2006 Very Average I was pretty disappointed with this hotel for the money. When you pay over USD300 per night you expect better than dirty, noisy, dated rooms and bad food. The breakfast restaurant was terrible. The staff were fairly unhelpful (although the airport pick up was good) and USD10 per 30 minutes for internet access was not acceptable. It is nowhere near a 5 star hotel, I would have thought the Intercontinental group would have better standards than this. I was disappointed. Nov 29 2006 Expensive but shabby We just got back from a stay here. Location was pretty good, but the hotel is way too expensive for what you get. We paid $380/night (including a +$40 2nd person fee). As other postings note, hotel is being rennovated and is noisy 24 hours a day. Rooms are drab as are the common areas in the hotel. Nov 16 2006 Worst hotel ever Just stayed at this hotel for three nights and what a dump. A mausoleum - shabby, old, dated, staid, run-down. The check-in staff are useless - half an-hour to check me out and still errors on the bill. The rooms are old, dated and very dirty. The shower fell to pieces. Don\\'t even think about the restaurant. The bar is dark and dingy and completely void of any atmosphere. The hotel has a pool which is used by pigeons and everthing/one gets pigeon excreta on them. Just don\\'t stay here.................. Oct 24 2006 Stay somewhere else! Stayed in this hotel while in India for two weeks on business, and it was not a pleasant experience. There are major renovations going on in the hotel, which means that you can expect to be kept awake by the hammering and drilling until well past 11 at night. Complaints to reception won\\'t get you anywhere.Internet connection is available for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 24 hours. You cannot simply ask to be connected for the duration of your stay. Even when you get connected, it is often very slow, or occasionally drops the signal.Everything in the hotel is ridiculously overpriced - a buffet breakfast will set you back 650 rupees. And don\\'t even consider wine with dinner, unless you fancy spending 2750 rupees on the cheapest bottle. (Wine that would be 20 euro max in another hotel - in another country - will set you back 60+ euro here.)The rooms were clean, but drab and dull. In the bathroom, the taps were water-stained, and rusting in places. And from my room at least there was no view to speak of.Hotel staff were generally very friendly - especially in the restaurants. And the food was pretty good.If you are looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights, then this hotel would be fine (but pricey), but any more than that and I would say stay somewhere else. And if you want value for money, you won\\'t find it here. Oct 7 2006 Get another hotel The hotel is under rebuilding and you will know it at your cost. Hammering, drilling, solvents, painting, etc., don\\'t contribute to an enjoyable stay.I requested to change room because of noise, the next room I was glad that improved, except that next day they started to paint that floor, so it was not very &quot;inspiring&quot;.The same problem one year ago.For the price we can have better options in Delhi.Never again ... Sep 25 2006 Very disappointing stay! I have just spent a week in the Intercontinental Grand, New Delhi. A very tired and ugly looking hotel. The rooms haven\\'t been refurbished for a long time. There was building work going on 24hours a day in a lift shaft near my room which kept me awake every night. The Chinese restaurant on the top floor has closed down, and on both nights when I went to the other restaurant on the top floor, I found I was the only person dining in there. The swimming pool has a net covering it to keep birds out except a dozen pigeons were trapped inside the netting flying around. The hotel is in a run down area of the city close to a highway and railway station with trains running through 24hours a day sounding their horns as they pass the station which is clearly audible from your room. Very annoying at 4am! Then on the last night, I was woken by maintenance at 00:30am to fix the lock on my door which I hadn\\'t even reported broken!!! And to make matters worse, my airport taxi hadn\\'t been booked and when the porters finally arranged one, the driver didn\\'t know his way to the airport!!! All this, at a cost of over $1000 for 6nights! There are much better hotels in Delhi for cheaper, I wouldn’t even bother considering this hotel! Jun 24 2006 Nothing Special reallly really not worth the money. rooms are ugly/old/ and not clean. don\\'t stay here. don\\'t be fooled by the nice lobby. Jun 21 2006 great hotel overall We stayed here for 2 nights in mid-December - our first stop on a 2 week trip to India. I had stayed here twice before as a young, single female traveler, and felt very safe/comfortable. This time I was with my husband and it was an equally good experience. Our room was in excellent condition, and since we were recovering from jet lag we spent quite a lot of time there! Room service food was quite good, as was the breakfast buffet. We had arranged to have our train tickets sent to the hotel prior to our arrival in India and the hotel staff gave them to us as soon as we checked in. I do think that the Intercontinental, like most 4-5* hotels in Delhi, is somewhat overpriced, but it\\'s worth it for a couple of nights particularly if you are just entering or about to exit the country. May 4 2006 Worst hotel I ever stayed in I wish I could give it a zero instead of one point. This place is absolutely crap. I got billed £500 plus in two days of stay (including food). The room was nothing to write home about - the cushions had stains on them from overuse. The bathroom was absolute rubbish. The service was poor. The staff seemed pretty clueless most of the time. They couldn\\'t arrange a taxi for me and kept me waiting for half an hour. And I had a horrible view of a train platform from my window. Nothing to write home about in terms of views. I will never never stay there again. May 3 2006 Great place to stay We stayed at this hotel in April for 3 night. We had a club room on the 23rd floor. We checked in on the 22nd floor which also has a large lounge where afternoon tea is served to guests as part of the room price. Dainty sandwiches and cakes with a selection of teas are available. Breakfast is sometimes served there as well.Our room was clean and well appointed with a king size bed wing chairs and large corner windows overlooking the city.Although not newly furnished it certainly was not old and tired. Believe me I have stayed a appalling hotels in England at much higher prices than this one with snotty indifferent staff. I found the staff well mannered attentive and ready to help in any way they could. On our last day there we stayed in our room till 3pm. Our plane did not leave till 1 am in the morning. The staff at the desk on the main floor had a whole list of suggestions on how we could spend our time until it was time for the Intercontinental limosine, which was included in the room price, took us to the airport.I read some of the reviews and I cannot relate them to our experience at this hotel. We had a great time there and would certainly stay there again when we go back to India. Apr 29 2006 solid hotel My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in April as a starting point for a 2 week jaunt through the north of India. I chose this hotel because we wanted something close to Connaught Place and we wanted a good chain. I was under the impression that being near C. P. would be convenient and we could walk there. But really, in retrospect, it\\'s not necessary. You can stay in a hotel that is further away and really not miss any centrality because you can\\'t walk anywhere! It is too dirty and overwhelming so you will wind up in a cab, which cost us $10 for 4 hours and the driver waited for us while went to eat, shop, etc. The hotel is beautiful and our room was great. They upgraded us to a junior suite and the view was stunning. However, all of Delhi smells due to the pollution and this extends into the hotel. I also think that the water they use to mop and in the fountains are really contaminated and smell horrible. But aestetically and service wise the hotel was great. Also, fyi, they charge you some ridiculous luxury tax in Delhi, this is typical of every hotel.We ate at the buffet for breakfast and dinner 1 night and didn\\'t find it to be anything to write home about. The bar food on the other hand was yummy! We had the chicken tikka massala and it was delicious. We ate in Zen in C.P. a chinese restaurant and it was excellent also. We went to a restaurant in G-K-I Market when we returned to Delhi, sorry don\\'t remember the name but it\\'s the only one there, and that was the best one.We thought that the hotel was beautiful. We wanted to use the pool but were absolutely exhausted and passed out on the 1st day after sightseeing. which, by the way, we got the cab driver for $25 for the whole day and he took us everywhere. So bargain with the driver when you get in. I hope this helps. I must say that the hotels in India were really expensive given that it is a developing country and how cheap everything else was! Also, we work for an airline and travel a lot just to give you an idea. We also stayed at the Taj Palace when we were returning so you can check out that write-up also. Apr 17 2006 Decent Hotel not great value New Delhi hotels are expensive and overpriced, that\\'s standard. Lack of competition and a shortage of anything 3*/4* keeps the prices of 5* hotels at a premium. You either go 5* or take a risk with a 2*...which other reviews show can be a very &quot;hit or miss&quot; affair.Intercontinental Grand is in a good location very close to Connaught Place.I stayed in a club room which included breakfast and evening canapes, beer, tea and coffee all day etc.. If you get a good deal it\\'s worth doing for a few dollars extra. Room was fine, bathroom a little tired with a few burn stains in the bath. Service was ok with housekeeping giving you extra complimentary waters for a few rupees tip. Swimming pool was quite good (smallish, but gets the afternoon sun). Only ate in the hotel on my last night before travelling onwards, got &quot;Delhi Belly&quot; after a meal at the hotel\\'s specialist Indian restaurant (which annoyed me intensely).On the whole, a decent hotel but poor value compared to others you might have stayed at. Mar 20 2006 The not so Grand Despite it not being our first choice but due to late booking we stayed at the intercontinetal thinking that the Intercontinetal name would provide reliability.We had a club suite, the room was old and tired it needed a refirb about 2 years ago. Service at the hotel was very average nothing excpetional. The food also was also nothing to write home about. Mar 18 2006 Grand is only so - so I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand for 8 days during the beginning of March 06. The hotel was average in general, certainly not up to the standards of what you would expect from InterContinental. They were prompt in picking me up from the airport late at night (an extra $50 charge) and they were always helpful and quick with requests for extra towels, etc. The rooms were dissapointing and I expected more for The $229usd I paid per night. A 12% tax was also added to all room charges but this would have been added to any hotel in the Delhi area. While in Delhi I read several articles in the local paper regarding the severe shortage of hotel rooms in the city. This is probably why they can get away with charging so much and offering so little. The room itself was tired and dated. The fuse for the lights blew when the bedside lamps were turned on the same time the blow dryer (if you could call it that) was on. The carpet was dirty and the shower curtain showed signs of mold growing on it. On the plus side, they did have duvet covers on the bed and not just a sheet and blanket. They did offer wireless internet access although it was a bit pricy ($5 per 30 minutes). The breakfast buffet was good and had several western style dishes available. There was a great pastry shop in the lobby and they brought unlimited complementary bottled water to to the room. The travel desk (run by a different company) located on the second floor was terrible. We bought plane tickets and paid for them only to show up at the airport and learn that they had been canceled by the travel agency and the money refunded to them. There are two very good, although very pricy restraunts on the top floor. The location of the hotel was a plus if you need to be in the center of the downtown. Only a 5 minute walk from Connaught Place and the main downtown area. I was in town for a convention and talked with several people who were staying at other similar hotels in Delhi. The general conclusion is: expect to pay outrageous prices for any 5 star hotel in Delhi and expect to be dissapointed by what you get for the money. Feb 6 2006 Horrible Hotel I put a group up in this hotel for a few nights this February and all participants hated it. First off, the concierges and check-in staff were rude and impatient, not to mention the fact that we were guaranteed better service if a male did transactions. The gender bias was appalling and embarrassing. Secondly, several people had plumbing or foul odour problems with their rooms, and although we paid for a higher grade of accomodations they simply refused to give them to us as they had overbooked. (Something I later found out, they are notorious for). For the cost of their rooms, they are simply not worth it. Period. Rooms are slightly run down with somewhat shabby bathrooms. They do have lots of shops, restaurant choices, and a beauty salon. Overall, the establishment is overwhelmingly large and comes with all the unfortunate problems usually associated with such a size. You will wait in long cues at the front desk, receive offhand customer service, and eat mediocre food. There really is nothing special about this hotel, so unless you are using its facilities for business, you are better off elsewhere. Jan 22 2006 The worst experience ever We were to stay in the hotel for 8 nights but cut our stay to just one night because:1)There was no heat in the rooms when it was 40F outside.2)The bathrooms had rust on the fixtures.3) The breakfast buffet had some stale and undercooked4) The lobby was dark and lighting was horrible kinda depressing acutally5)people were out to trick you at the business center especially overcharing for the internet service. Jan 8 2006 Not what you would expect from an Intercontinental Stayed here for 3 nights in May, 2005. The five stars must be because of the impressive lobby \\'cause it sure ain\\'t the rooms. After a grueling 24 hour journey in coach from California, checking in at 1 a.m. and only semiconscious and wanting nothing more than to put head to pillow, the clerk was extremely aggressive trying to get me to join the Intercontinental hotel club (or something like that) at some exorbitant membership price. Could have lived without that. As others have stated, the rooms were tired and in need of an overhaul. Windows dirty, bathroom mirror hazed over like you normally see in some 200 year old historic house. I like my hotel rooms on the cold side especially when it is the hottest time of the year in Delhi (110 degrees). Even though I cranked up the temperature as high as it would go, never got more than a cool breeze. It wasn\\'t hot but not nearly as cool as I would have like it. When checking out the last morning of my stay, I requested to leave 1 medium sized bag and my computer with storage until I was due to fly out that night. They said they wouldn\\'t store the computer due to previous guests complaints about damage. I asked them if they really expected me to haul my computer bag around all day while walking through Old Delhi. After a lengthy discussion, we finaly agreed on a compromise, that I would lock my computer in my luggage but this took 20 minutes of needless hassle. On the plus size, the guy who cleaned my room was very nice and provided extra bottles of water as requested (free) and the food and staff in the Woks restaurant was outstanding. Not sure why the place was empty both times I ate there when everything was so good and reasonably priced. The hotel is convenient to Connaught Place and both Old and New Delhi.I reserved way in advance on the Holiday Inn website and got a great rate a bit more than USD100 per night. For that rate, it was serviceable but for a rate of $200-300, you should be able to do much better. Jan 3 2006 Good choice Won\\'t be the best 5 star that you ever stay in, but it is a good choice for a few days in Delhi. The staff were helpful and the service generally was pretty good. The rooms were a bit dark and could do with some freshening, but they were functional and comfortable. We stayed in a Club Room and found complimentary water, chocolates and cookies waiting for us on our arrival. Breakfast is good. One tip if the main breakfast area is busy, is to go to Woks restaurant on the first floor. Same breakfast, lots of eager waiters, absolutely no other guests ... Dec 19 2005 overrated hotel Stayed here earlier this month. Hotel is centrally located and has spacious rooms with big beds and some excellent dining options. However, rooms look a bit tired and bathroom, carpet and linen are not very clean. At the time of check-out, the hotel clerk (unjustly) claimed that my travel agent hadn\\'t made full payment for the room and forced me to sign an unspecified check. Since I had only half an hour to catch my train, I had no option. My travel agent has lodged a complaint with the hotel. All in all a bit disappointing for a hotel that charged me 240 dollar a night. Nov 30 2005 good centrally located hotel This hotel is a good 5* hotel centrally located in the heart of Delhi. While not the &quot;best&quot; 5* in the city, it is not the most expensive either. It has most things that a traveler looks for, including a variety of restaurants (though the service could be stepped up), small shops, business centre, large rooms and courteous staff. Would recommend as far as the big chains go. Nov 3 2005 Reasonable Sep 11 2005 Not 5 star.... Aug 31 2005 Grand but not great Jul 13 2005 Not up to luxury hotel standards May 8 2005 Fabulous Hotel! A perfect experience! Apr 13 2005 A 2-star masquerading as a 4-star Mar 26 2005 Well located Mar 24 2005 not worth the price Jan 31 2005 Worthy of the name \"Inter-Continental\"? Jan 7 2005 Nice Hotel Nov 7 2009 ??????????????????? Oct 10 2009 ?????? Feb 11 2009 ??????? Sep 25 2008 ???????

I think the best thing about this hotel is the nice cheap currys, the friendly staff the giantic beds and they offer cable which has a few english speaking channels. Location is not too bad either everything u need is reachable which a short walk its just round the cornor from a train station where u can catch trains too places all round india a good place too go from here thats not too far away is agra where u can see the Taj Mahal Jun 30 2009 Hell on earth The hotel is filthy, the staff are all dishonest. The Manager is even worse than the staff, I am used to travelling in India, but this hotel and any in its group are to be avoided.Room service tried to charge 200 INR for 2 bottles of coke (menu price less than 40 INR)Sandwich 600 rupee, menu price 65 rupee.We needed a room on our return to Delhi, the manager promised to upgrade us for the one night, the room in in the nearby Yuvraj was just has filthy (someone's period stains were on &quot;clean sheets&quot;) The upgraded room is listed as 1200 rupees on their website, the manager tried to charge 2800 rupees. there is not a hotel on that street that charges over 1500 rupees per night.Avoid this group like the plague. Mar 1 2009 Do Not Stay Here! Do not let the reception fool you, we got a warm welcome but it went downhill from there. The room was dirty and smelly. We got ripped off due to taking the services offered by the hotel and the one time we got food from the hotel we couldnt eat it as it wasnt cooked right! On a more positive note there was security in the hotel and once youve stayed here anywere else will seem lovely. May 24 2008 This so-called hotel is awful I had to stay at Chand Palace in April 2008 for 5 days before I left India after a 3 month stay in New Delhi. You will see a lot of dirtness all over Delhi but you should expect that at a place where you pay that much money. The room itself - with a window which was too small to see the wall on the otherside of the &quot;street&quot; - was some how clean but the bathroom was a disaster. The basin was broken, the water was so strange that you couldn't use it for brushing your teeth - it's the only place I have seen where you can't even use the tube water for that purpose - the only towel I got during the whole stay was dirty and had some stains from someone who was spitting pan in it, you will have just one winter blanket, which is useless for temperatures like 20 to 30 degrees during the night. Beside that, you should take some earplugs with you otherwise you are not able to sleep because of all that noise.The food was like the street food 20 Rps. which you can get everywhere in Delhi but here you will be at least 100 Rps. Furthermore, we you check in the hotel and ask for the price of the stay, then do that in a written form. I asked the desk manager before my check in and at the end it was nearly the double of the price. If you really want to enjoy that beautiful country and city than choose some of the other, less expensive and pleasent and really nice hotels - I mean one of the houses that is worth calling it a hotel - in New Delhi. Feb 4 2008 Terrible in every aspect We stayed there for 3 nights in January.It was by far the worst and most expensive room we had in our holidays...:-No daylight-VERY loud-Dirty -Very cold (no real windows).-Slum-like neighborhood-No hot water (we actually paid for hot water)-VERY unfriendly staff-Very expensive in comparisonAt the checkout they cheated with the account.So, just stay away from this [--] hole and look in Lonely Planetfor decent rooms...Regards,Christoph Dec 10 2007 It was terrible and dirty Dirty!! the staff is always spitting. Noisy. Jun 12 2007 Terrible slum Dark dingy room with leaking toilet, wierd unfriendly service, yellow dirty cold and smelling &quot;shower&quot;/pipe water. Stayed only one night thankfully, was worst night of 4month trip, even the hotel's own driver rips you off (400rps to conaught place via an unwelcome stop at his friend's restaurant!). Place accross the 'street' is a falling down firework factory...take care! If you are used to any sort of basic comfort then stay somewhere in southern New Delhi, not Paranganj! Positive reviews must be from hotel owner or staff, this place is not remotely acceptable even to a backpacker, certainly not at GBP20/night in India! We stayed in many other places in India, and hence I know how poor quality this places is compared to others around the country. Don't be fooled by the front desk, these places seems to spend their whole budget on the lobby alone! Feb 25 2007 Total Dump Dirtiest and filthy place we had ever stayed, expected better in the capital, Holes in the wall with area around the Air conditioner open, noise, cold air and polltuion of delhi can be well savoured here.Place was dirty, we changed room 3 times in 2 nights, hot water problem, not on till the reception want a shower.Room smelt of Shitand Urine, may be the Delhi aroma as all Indian ciites now a days. POLLUTION.Fake reviews may be from locals not from poor foreigners who are conned into these hotels. Even the ELECTRIC SWITCH IN THE BATH ROOM WAS HANGING OUT OF THE WALL. hEALTH &amp; SAFETY IS -zeerroo- Oct 19 2006 Good Hotel! Good Hotel!It was great. We had a clean comfortable room. Checkin &amp; Checkout service was great&amp; quick. Oct 15 2006 Not a any star hotel no airport pick up unless advance payment...reservation didnot mean anything......endup picking up taxi (300rs for two)salty running water and it is yellow (non filtered from river yamuna)other people airport pick up was charged dubble becuse diffrent flight....promished 175Rs per person...charged ....300 per person we stayed two night group of 28 people..(since was schduale gethering there...we had no choice).cocroch runs for life soon as light turn on....rooms are not near what show on site ...showed on site is model 2 rooms....not a deluxe ac rooms.bed sheets had a blood spots. replacement had similer other stain......resturent will bring food from outside and charge guest triple price ....no big vehical go in a doorway .unless you have small economy car .....it is not on main road....forget about parking (no parking at all...place stink like dump site ...or rotten egg........no running hot water ......only for 6-8am ...other wise take a bath peal...2 tea and 4.tost cost Rs.500 charge guest for bakery not for bread.....i ask him i don't want to buy bakery...place is worst than privet motel in us ........ Oct 8 2006 Good security It was a bit quite.Good Security!Room and bathroom were clean.Bed was so comfortable.Everything was Good. May 8 2006 One night no problems I stayed for one night here and found it fine. Nice staff, good location, my ride to the airport came quickly and was resonably priced, the phone worked, as did everything else in the room. There were a few creepy crawlies in the bathroom but they didn't bother me! I would stay here again but next time I go to India I will be on a tighter budget and this will be a little over. Apr 28 2006 RUN from this place! Terrible location. Very dirty. Broken toilet, broken and filthy fridge, and broken air conditioner. Rooms smelled like dead fish. Don't even think of a good nights rest here. Mar 3 2006 One of the best hotel Loved It I stayed three days in this hotel and found that this place was remarkable with best staff. I recieved warm welcome at the airport with the pickup and the hotel was very nice and loved it so much. This hotel consulted me a tour which was great recomended by Raman who runs Akshat Tours and Travel, I would recomed it to all my travel minded friends... Dec 4 2005 Hotel Chand Palace-poor Having already booked with Expedia, I was expecting worse when I read reviews such as those atandHowever, I had only paid the minimum rate for a room and I did have a window, a fridge, a TV, my own loo (which leaked) and a fan (the noise of which was very necessary at night to blank out other noises. There was no hot water, the room was dirty (but not crawling!), and many fittings were broken. There were a lot of (friendly)staff who never a seemed to do anything unless you actually gave them the bin to empty.It was just about OK for me, but I could not recommend it unless you are desperate to save your last dollar Oct 22 2005 dirty building site This is not a nice hotel. It is basic but not at all clean. It is currently undergoing building work and together with hotel being built next door means there is constant drilling, welding and hammering from early am til late at night. The room was damp and the carpet crawling, literally. The food was okay and the staffwere nice enough but if you need some sleep, forget it. Also, room had no windows and broken AC unit. Jun 29 2005 Friendly Hotel I stayed in Hotel Chand Palace 2 nights and i was very happy to know this hotel where the employees are very kindly with guests and i will recommend this hotel to my friends.Gerard Luzi Nov 4 2006 Une séjour plaisant\", doc_id='e736d058-37ca-413d-b8a5-e87dd475b8a8', embedding=None, doc_hash='290dbac50d0d342448565bbc036222b91dd78d6fd4b0d7df5ba9bb6d15e800da', extra_info=None)]]\n"
